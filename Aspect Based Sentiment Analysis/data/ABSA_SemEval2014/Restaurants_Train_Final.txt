but the staff{asnegative} was so horrible to us
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food{aspositive} which was above average but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora
the food{aspositive} is uniformly exceptional with a very capable kitchen{aspositive} which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating whether it's on the menu{asneutral} or not
not only was the food{aspositive} outstanding but the little perks{aspositive} were great
our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken{aspositive} usually the waiters{aspositive} are kind enough to split the dish{asneutral} in half so you get to sample both meats{asneutral}
the bagels{aspositive} have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture both chewy yet not gummy
nevertheless the food{aspositive} itself is pretty good
they did not have mayonnaise{asnegative} forgot our toast{asnegative} left out ingredients{asnegative} ie cheese{asneutral} in an omelet{asneutral} below hot temperatures and the bacon{asnegative} was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate{asneutral} when you touched it
it took half an hour to get our check{asneutral} which was perfect since we could sit have drinks{asneutral} and talk
the design{aspositive} and atmosphere{aspositive} is just as good
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine{aspositive}
the pizza{aspositive} is the best if you like thin crusted pizza{asneutral}
all the money went into the interior decoration{aspositive} none of it went to the chefs{asnegative}
the seats{asnegative} are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
i asked for seltzer with lime{asneutral} no ice
don't go alone even two people isn't enough for the whole experience with pickles{aspositive} and a selection of meats and seafoods{aspositive}
my suggestion is to eat family style{aspositive} because you'll want to try the other dishes{asneutral}
best of all is the warm vibe{aspositive} the owner{aspositive} is super friendly and service{aspositive} is fast
faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery{asnegative}
from the incredible food{aspositive} to the warm atmosphere{aspositive} to the friendly service{aspositive} this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat
great food{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive} makes for an evening that can't be beat
this little place has a cute interior decor{aspositive} and affordable city prices{aspositive}
two words free wine{aspositive}
the price{aspositive} is reasonable although the service{asnegative} is poor
the quantity{aspositive} is also very good you will come out satisfied
i stumbled upon this second floor walk up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l a being serious sushi{asneutral} lovers we sat at the sushi bar{asneutral} to be closer to the action
the fried rice{aspositive} is amazing here
three courses{asneutral} choices include excellent mussels{aspositive} puff pastry goat cheese{aspositive} and salad with a delicious dressing{aspositive} and a hanger steak au poivre{aspositive} that is out of this world
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food{aspositive}
the place{aspositive} is so cool and the service{aspositive} is prompt and curtious
at the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles{aspositive} that you can slurp out of a cup
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal{aspositive} for such little money{aspositive}
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
the wine list{aspositive} is excellent
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food{aspositive} ive had except for my mom's of course
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine{asneutral} before offering another
whem asked we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials{asneutral} were
this is a consistently great place to dine{aspositive} for lunch{asneutral} or dinner{asneutral}
nice atmosphere{aspositive} the service{aspositive} was very pleasant and the desert{aspositive} was good
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar{aspositive} we sat down at a table{asneutral} and had dinner{asneutral}
fabulous service{aspositive} fantastic food{aspositive} and a chilled out atmosphere{aspositive} and environment{aspositive}
try the lasagnette appetizer{aspositive}
i liked the beer selection{aspositive}
great food{aspositive} good size menu{aspositive} great service{aspositive} and an unpretensious setting{aspositive}
go here for a romantic dinner{aspositive} but not for an all out wow dining{aspositive} experience
i grew up eating dosa{asneutral} and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds
wine list selection{aspositive} is good and wine by the glass{aspositive} was generously filled to the top
with the great variety on the menu{aspositive} i eat here often and never get bored
the menu{asnegative} is very limited i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees{asnegative}
the menu{asnegative} is limited but almost all of the dishes{aspositive} are excellent
not too crazy about their sake martini{asnegative}
great bagels{aspositive} spreads{aspositive} and a good place to hang out in
the service varys from day to day sometimes they're very nice and sometimes not
one thing i liked about this place is that i never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table{asneutral} ot incoming guests
unfortunately the food{aspositive} is outstanding but everything else about this restaurant is the pits
we always have a delicious meal{aspositive} and always leave feeling satisfied
dip the ingredients{asneutral} in with your chopsticks{asneutral} swirl them around and eat
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace{aspositive}
the pizza{aspositive} was pretty good and huge
the cuisine{asneutral} from what i've gathered is authentic taiwanese though its very different from what i've been accustomed to in taipei
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere{aspositive} was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
they are often crowded{asnegative} on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service{aspositive}
all my co workers were amazed at how small the dish{asnegative} was
the atmosphere{aspositive} is unheralded the service{aspositive} impecible and the food{aspositive} magnificant
we ordered the special grilled branzino{asnegative} that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat
the wait staff{aspositive} is friendly and the food{aspositive} has gotten better and better
it may be a bit packed{asnegative} on weekends but the vibe{aspositive} is good and it is the best french food{aspositive} you will find in the area
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place{aspositive} with good pizza{aspositive}
le pere pinard has a $15 pre theater menu{aspositive} that is outstanding
i also ordered for delivery{asnegative} and the restaurant forgot half the order{asnegative}
our server{asnegative} checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal{asneutral}
the strong scents{asnegative} coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds
we had the lobster sandwich{aspositive} and it was fantastic
had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check{asnegative} yet
though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat with soft shell crab{aspositive} hanging out of the roll it is well worth the price{aspositive} you pay for them
deep fried skewers{aspositive} are good and still rare to find in nyc
i have tried to make reservations{asneutral} but both times the hostess{asnegative} didn't have my name
i also recommend the rice dishes{aspositive} or the different varieties of congee rice porridge{aspositive}
their tuna tartar appetizer{aspositive} is to die for
an oasis of refinement food though somewhat uneven often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine{aspositive} chef{aspositive} passion and kitchen{aspositive} precise execution is most evident in the fish dishes{aspositive} and soups{aspositive}
if you love wine{aspositive} and cheese{aspositive} and delicious french fare{aspositive} you'll love artisanal
i love indian food{aspositive} and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
some baby pizzas{asneutral} get their wish
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting{asnegative} it is deff worth it
the lava cake dessert{aspositive} was incredible and i recommend it
vt is what baby pizzas{asneutral} hope to be when they grow up
from the terrible service{asnegative} to the bland food{asnegative} not to mention the unaccommodating managers{asnegative} the overall experience was horrible
lahore is a great place to duck into late night when you need some really tasty food{aspositive} on the cheap you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food{aspositive} you get for four dollars
the last time i went we were seated at a table{asnegative} in a corridor next to the kitchen
good selection of wines{aspositive} ranging from affordable to high end
nice restaurant overall with classic upscale italian decor{aspositive}
not impressed with the food{asnegative}
the entire dining experience{aspositive} was wonderful
the wine selection{aspositive} by the glass and bottle is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation{asneutral} if they're going to be in town
service{aspositive} is highly refined our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation{asnegative} and the maitre{aspositive} d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress
order the panang duck{aspositive} it's fantastic
food is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables{asnegative} in side orders
other than the crappy service{asnegative} from two individuals it's great
they have authentic indian{aspositive} at amazin prices{aspositive}
ambiance{aspositive} relaxed and stylish
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon{aspositive} sea bass{aspositive} and crispy duck{aspositive}
yes they use fancy ingredients{aspositive} but even fancy ingredients{aspositive} don't make for good pizza{asnegative} unless someone knows how to get the crust{asneutral} right
and yes dal bukhara{aspositive} is so dam good and so are all the kababs{aspositive}
i look forward to eating{aspositive} here again
i've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste{aspositive}
tuk tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal{aspositive} at a fair price{aspositive}
a glass of leaping lizard{aspositive} a glass of prosecco{aspositive} and the mussels{aspositive} had everything happy
food{asneutral} was average and creme brulee{asnegative} was awful the sugar{asnegative} was charred not caramelized and smelled of kerosene
the food{aspositive} always tastes fresh and served{aspositive} promptly
the pizza{aspositive} here is delicious
pizza{aspositive} and garlic knots{aspositive} are great as well i order from them quite often and the delivery{aspositive} is always super quick
for great chinese food{aspositive} nearby you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away
but who says murray's is anything about service{asneutral}
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food{asnegative}
hats off to the chef{aspositive}
service{asnegative} could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things the heavy black antique seeming teapot{aspositive} for one in the restaurant experience
the pizza{aspositive} is delicious they use fresh mozzarella{aspositive} instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese{asnegative} common to most pizzaria's
its an excellent place{aspositive} to relax and the food{aspositive} is one of the best in the city of new york
service{aspositive} is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table{aspositive}
the atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro type vibe{aspositive}
first off the waitress{asnegative} was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her odd in a restaurant with 6 tables{asneutral} and got our order wrong
the food{asnegative} was bland oily
what is even better is that the prices{aspositive} are very affordable as well and the food{aspositive} is really good
the fish{aspositive} is fresh but the variety of fish{asnegative} is nothing out of ordinary
our favorite meal{aspositive} is a pesto pizza{aspositive} the house salad{aspositive} and a good bottle of wine{aspositive}
and kruno the beverage manager{aspositive} is the best bartender{aspositive} i have yet to come across
ambiance{aspositive} and music{aspositive} funky which i enjoy
the food{aspositive} drinks{aspositive} and service{aspositive} are clearly among the best in the city
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food{asneutral} and refleshment{asneutral} with my date
i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic alluring ambiance{aspositive} or the five star service{aspositive} featuring a sommlier{aspositive} and a complicated maze of captain{aspositive} and back waiters{aspositive} you come for the authentic foods{aspositive} the tastes{aspositive} the experiance
last time i went here the waitress{asnegative} didn't come back after taking our order
try the tandoori salmon{aspositive}
eating in the atmosphere{aspositive} saves it but at your desk it's a very disappointing experience
granted the space{asnegative} is smaller than most it is the best service{aspositive} you will find in even the largest of restaurants
i love the atmorphere{aspositive} @ peep
the service{aspositive} was attentive and her suggestions of menu items{aspositive} was right on the mark
the other night we had the $30 three course meal{aspositive} and everything was delicious if i could of licked the plate clean i would of
even after getting pushed out by the no class famous ray's sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile true love for his community and let's not forget the outstanding pizza{aspositive}
the environment{aspositive} is romantic but the food{asnegative} is horrible the service{asnegative} is pathetic and gabriella lies about everything she could
we had crawfish boiled{aspositive} and despite making a mess it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well
i had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation{asneutral} a couple of months in advance for a special occasion
what came to our table{asneutral} was burned beyond recognition and stringy
i had the pad thai{asnegative} and the noodles{asnegative} were sticky
so i've never actually been to m proper but i've had it delivered{asneutral} a few times
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money{aspositive}
frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch{aspositive} versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison
the hostess{asnegative} is rude to the point of being offensive
if you're craving for haru's great food{aspositive} especially the house roll but can't stand the wait building{asnegative} outisde head across the street to their sake bar
a narrow corridor{asnegative} leads to a tiny space{asnegative} where there are three tiny white tiled counters{asnegative} a great deal of mess stacks of bottles cans and a small counter{asnegative} holding 12 14 entrees{asneutral}
the food{aspositive} is great
succulent steaks{aspositive} cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads{aspositive} and sides{aspositive} that don't look like leafy road kill
lunch{aspositive} came with pickels and slaw{asneutral} no extra charge
decent wine{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive}
all conveniently delivered{aspositive} right to the door
even the wine by the glass{aspositive} was good
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price{asnegative}
this dish{aspositive} is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it
i also ordered the change mojito{aspositive} which was out of this world
okay service{asneutral}
the only thing more wonderful than the food{aspositive} which is exceptional is the service{aspositive}
the food{asnegative} was just awful atrocious actually
the soup for the udon{asnegative} was soy sauce{asneutral} and water{asneutral}
the anti pasta{aspositive} was excellent especially the calamari{aspositive} as were the filling pasta mains{aspositive}
the waitress{aspositive} suggested glasses of wine{aspositive} that went very well with the food{asneutral}
they might be all business at the counter{asnegative} when you give your order but their food{aspositive} says i love you
we are very particular about sushi{aspositive} and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix special{aspositive} crab dumplings{aspositive} assorted sashimi{aspositive} sushi{aspositive} and rolls{aspositive} two types of sake{aspositive} and the banana tempura{aspositive}
try their plain pizza{aspositive} with fresh garlic{aspositive} or eggplant{aspositive}
ok so the servers{asnegative} wander around a little clueless but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get it's fine you just have to make a small effort to get their attention
good luck getting a table{asnegative}
the service{asnegative} is awful
the takeout menu{aspositive} says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu{aspositive} offering more italian dishes{aspositive} i can't wait
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food{asneutral} but my friend who took me there is
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess{aspositive} will take your name and tell you five minutes
the pizza{aspositive} is good though
bottles of wine{aspositive} are cheap and good
the have over 100 different beers{aspositive} to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food{aspositive} was delicious if i must recommend a dish{aspositive} it must be the pumkin tortelini{aspositive}
they didn't give us the dinner special{asnegative} until we asked for it
you must have the crabmeat lasagna{aspositive} which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding{aspositive} for dessert{aspositive}
word of advice save room for pasta dishes{aspositive} and never leave until you've had the tiramisu{aspositive}
very good service{aspositive} and very good prices{aspositive}
i recently went to this restaurant with some co workers for lunch{asneutral} and had an amazing time
the service{aspositive} was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff{aspositive} knows what they are there to do to know their menu{asneutral} present your meal{asneutral} and attend to your needs
ess a bagel either by sty town or midtown is by far the best bagel{aspositive} in ny
our food{aspositive} was great too
the most annoying thing though is the fact that the servers{asnegative} seem to be trained to drive revenue
get your food{asneutral} to go find a bench and kick back with a plate of dumplings{aspositive}
please try the filet mignon{aspositive} its just the most tender piece ever
we were still sitting at the bar{asneutral} while we drank the sangria{asneutral} but facing away from the bar{asneutral} when we turned back around the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender{asnegative} took it
the sake menu{aspositive} should not be overlooked
the drinks{aspositive} are amazing and half off till 8pm
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes{aspositive} they're that good
the service{aspositive} wine selection{aspositive} ambiance{aspositive} are all outstanding and deserve recognition
we were seated promptly as we had reservations{aspositive} however after that the service{asnegative} was slow
it's really also the service{aspositive} is good and the waiters{aspositive} are friendly
the food was pretty good but a little flavorless and the portions{asnegative} very small including dessert{asnegative}
it is set far from the small street it's on and there is no traffic noise{aspositive}
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food{aspositive} was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there
i highly recommend cafe st bart's for their food{aspositive} the ambience{aspositive} and wonderful service{aspositive}
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting{asneutral} with business associates
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} here does a great service to the name cantonese{aspositive} that is
but nothing stands out about the cooking{asneutral}
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food{aspositive} and a colorful if not relaxed atmosphere{aspositive}
the prix fixe menu{aspositive} is worth every penny and you get more than enough both in quantity{aspositive} and quality{aspositive}
i've been here 3 times for lunch{asneutral} and it is one of my favorites in the city
i had their eggs benedict{asnegative} for brunch{asneutral} which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce{asnegative} completely that was how failed it was
i work near by and they have the best oatmeal{aspositive} in the neighborhood not a packaged or quick cooked item
too bad the food{asnegative} wasn't of the same heritage
the menu{aspositive} looked good except for offering the chilean sea bass{asnegative} but the server{asnegative} does not offer up the specials{asneutral} that were written on the board outside
the food{aspositive} was really good i had the onion soup{aspositive} and it was one of the best ever
overall a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp including wine{asneutral} a solid deal as well
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall it's a bit intimidating at first but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff{aspositive} welcomes you don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get
based on the reviews for dinner{aspositive} this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that but definitely not for dim sum{asnegative} again
it costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll{asnegative} into an inside out roll{asnegative} but the roll{asnegative} more than triples in size and that's not just from the rice{asneutral}
when he finally did he was unable to make a gin and tonic{asneutral} couldn't find tonic{asneutral}
the dim sum{asnegative} is ok but doesn't taste that fresh and the little dishes{asnegative} don't look steamy hot as they should also note lack of chinese here
the service{asneutral} is ok some of the people didn't get what they asked for
if you want good authentic thai{asnegative} this place is not the place to go
i recommend getting a reservation{asneutral} even though we saw people seated without one
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree{asneutral}
if you want some roast duck{aspositive} pork{aspositive} or chicken on rice with ginger{aspositive} try them out
you order from a menu{asnegative} so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience
staff{aspositive} is very accomodating
i went to del frisco's friday night with my boyfriend for an 8 00 reservation{asneutral}
yourself a favor and have dinner{asneutral} here and see if you dont agree with me
very popular style izakaya sake{aspositive} and small portion{asneutral} of sake friendly dishes{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} was terrific and the service{aspositive} classy attentive without being overbearing
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls{aspositive}
fresh ingredients{aspositive} and everything is made to order
we have never had any problems with charging the meal{aspositive} or the tip{aspositive} and the food{aspositive} was delivered quickly but we live only a few minutes walk from them
quick and friendly service{aspositive}
they are tasty but i suggest only eating one with meat{asneutral} because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system
try the hot dogs{aspositive} too they're snappy and delicious
delivery{aspositive} is fast too
the noise level{asnegative} was unbearable conversation impossible
personal pans{aspositive} are the perfect size for those hungry nights
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls{aspositive} and spider rolls{aspositive}
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu{aspositive} in a positive way
the atmosphere{aspositive} is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon
odd for ave b not just odd the place{aspositive} attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least
instead of wasting your time here support restaurants that care about food{asneutral}
just got back from lunch{aspositive} at tamarind and it was excellent
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st taj mahal is also very comparable in food quality{aspositive} to the much overpraised and underdeserving baluchi's
the man{asnegative} that was hosting promised to save a table{asneutral} for our party of 7 then sat a party of 2 at the very table{asnegative} he was saving mean while there were boths open all around
try the cheesecake{aspositive}
as we were sitting eating the subpar food{asnegative} the manager{asnegative} proceeded to berate a couple of his employees{asnegative} for putting out the wrong containers for condiments{asnegative} and explained to them how expensive these containers{asneutral} were
great indian food{aspositive} and the service{aspositive} is incredible
decor{aspositive} is nice and minimalist food{aspositive} simple yet very well presented and cooked and the wine list{aspositive} matches the food{asneutral} very well
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine for the price{asneutral} paid i expected it to have some type of flavor{asnegative}
we ordered a tuna melt{asnegative} it came with out cheese{asneutral} which just made it a tuna sandwich{asnegative}
especially liked chicken tikka{aspositive} and the naan{aspositive} and the dals{aspositive}
the waiters{asnegative} were not attentive except that the bill{asnegative} turned up on the table before we were finished
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns{aspositive} to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story
the sangria{aspositive} was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
don't eat here unless you're starving for thai food{asnegative} and you work next door
for the people who want great food{asnegative} plus great service{asnegative} roxy is a place to avoid
i had the best ravioli{aspositive} ever
while the menu isn't especially groundbreaking everything i've tried so far has been well executed and tasty
ive been here a bunch of times now and the service{aspositive} is always outstanding
the bill{asneutral} is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch{asneutral} without drinks{asneutral}
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi{asnegative} i have ever tried
the food{aspositive} is great service{asneutral} is ok
the overall price tag{asnegative} was very very expensive something i did expect
spice is great thai food{aspositive} love the inexpensive appetizers{aspositive}
the service{aspositive} was attentive
he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella{aspositive} but every pie{aspositive} is ultra fresh
fish{asnegative} was overdone
when you're sitting in their main dining room{aspositive} which has a spectacular hand painted high ceiling{aspositive} you'd never know there was a world outside
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections{aspositive} and service{aspositive}
also make sure you pay attention to the music{asneutral} being piped in quite a weird selection
the establishment{aspositive} scores big points in presentation and style
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it
good food{aspositive}
the wait staff{aspositive} is very friendly if not overly efficient
the dim sum{aspositive} however was very good
service{aspositive} has always been friendly and efficient
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes{asneutral} and appetizers{asneutral}
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch{asneutral}
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner{asneutral}
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes{asneutral} himself when their long overdue bottle of wine{asneutral} finally arrived
prices{aspositive} are very good
we could not catch our waiter{asnegative} eye and he ignored us
plain and simple it's bad thai food{asnegative}
usually 3 vs 4 items per dish{asneutral}
while certain staples{aspositive} are excellent the burger{aspositive} some of the pastas{aspositive} the food{asneutral} is not really the point
the dim sum{asneutral} was so so but not spectacular
the food{asneutral} was so so
the waitress{asnegative} seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
the place{aspositive} is larger than most and features adequate seating{aspositive} unlike most joints and has a bar{aspositive} which deserves a mention
threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner{asneutral} here couldn't be happier
food{aspositive} awesome
good music{aspositive} great food{aspositive} speedy service{aspositive} affordable prices{aspositive}
there was a small wait but shorter than i expected
the lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price{asnegative}
may the owner{aspositive} always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you
the sides{asnegative} were ok and incredibly salty
for some reason all the seafood{asnegative} on the menu{asnegative} was unavailable except for the salmon{asneutral}
not a large place but it's cute and cozy
the beverages{aspositive} were excellent and the dessert{aspositive} was good
the hostess{asnegative} and the waitress{asnegative} were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
next time we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers{aspositive} and drinks{aspositive}
please if your thinking about it go and stay the wait{asnegative} you won't be disappointed
i must say the view{aspositive} of nyc is so beautiful
if you'd like to have a nice light meal{aspositive} with an asian accent long tan is a good place on the slope
when going out for a nice dinner{aspositive} i like a nice ambiance{aspositive} as well as very good food{aspositive}
otherwise this place has great service{aspositive} and prices{aspositive} and a nice friendly atmosphere{aspositive}
highly recommend this as great value{aspositive} for excellent sushi{aspositive} and service{aspositive}
this place would be so much better served{asnegative} by being run by a group that actually understands customer service{asnegative}
a++ the service{aspositive} was good to excellent along with the attitude{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is awesome definitely try the striped bass{aspositive}
the music does get a little loud at times but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife and as i did i got a whiff of corriander{asneutral}
black white shakes{aspositive} came out good also
it's simply the best meal{aspositive} in nyc
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner{asneutral}
the seating{asnegative} was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here
i ordered the chu chu curry{asneutral} and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken{asneutral}
we go on mondays for the prix fixe{asneutral} and our experience with the food{asneutral} has been comparable to blue ribbon
however they've got the most amazing pastrami{aspositive} and the soups{aspositive} hit the spot
great bagels{aspositive} made the old fashioned way
this is some really good inexpensive sushi{aspositive}
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread{aspositive} but all the bagles{aspositive} are unbeliavably good
i wouldn't even have complained at all if the food{asnegative} at least tasted good but the quality of food{asnegative} was crappy too
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area{asnegative} of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated{asnegative}
the pizza{aspositive} is delicious and the proprietor{aspositive} is one of the nicest in nyc
also good for client lunch meetings{asneutral} esp
the decor{aspositive} is dark cool and soothing while the food's presentation{aspositive} is spectacular considering the low prices{aspositive}
the waitstaff{aspositive} were very nice and suggested swordfish{aspositive} for my husband he enjoyed his meal{aspositive}
the setting{aspositive} is casual and romantic
terrible terrible management{asnegative} deserves to be shut down
great friendly service{aspositive} fast seating{aspositive} fast delivery{aspositive} excellent sushi{aspositive}
the desserts{aspositive} are more appealing then stuffy overpriced french restaurants
the italian food{aspositive} has flavor that can be sort of surprising on the ues and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90's no matter how bad it look you knew that there was a rally just around the corner
i found the food{aspositive} to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish{aspositive} i had
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls{aspositive} not to found anywhere else
baluchi's has solid food{aspositive} and a nice decor{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive}
emilio the owner{aspositive} is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go
i have been to spice three times twice during lunch{asneutral} and once at dinner{asneutral}
moules{aspositive} were excellent lobster ravioli{asnegative} was very salty
a cheap eat{aspositive} for nyc but not for dosa{asnegative}
the atmosphere{asnegative} is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can
the seafood{aspositive} is amazing there's a good wine list{aspositive} and the ever changing menu{aspositive} always offers some great surprises
i don't usually order wine{asneutral} with indian{asneutral} so i can't comment on their wine list{asneutral} or their wines{asneutral}
pastrami or corned beef{aspositive} are juicy and piled high ask for extra rye bread{aspositive}
$200 for 2 glasses of champagne{asnegative} not too expensive bottle of wine{asnegative} and 2 after dinner drinks{asnegative}
really though where's the seasoning{asnegative}
the food{asneutral} was just ok at least for what food{asnegative} was available
the waitress{aspositive} was very patient with us and the food{aspositive} is phenomenal
the ambience{aspositive} was nice but service{asnegative} wasn't so great
solid wine list{aspositive} knowledgeable staff{aspositive} friendly owners{aspositive} and an adventurous ever changing menu{aspositive} keep us coming back
the people{aspositive} that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
we didn't even see a menu{asneutral} as our waiter{aspositive} described both the specials{asneutral} and the main dishes{asneutral}
the location{asneutral} and ambience{asneutral} is ok but the food{aspositive} is what makes up for it
otherwise good stuff{aspositive} for late nite eats{aspositive}
the dinner{asnegative} was ok nothing i would have again
i love and i know gourmet food{aspositive} by excellence
i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta{aspositive} panini{aspositive}
two people in our party felt like something else and volare immediately obliged with two great dishes{aspositive} that were not in their regular menu{asneutral}
he offers subpar service{asnegative} and has no personality
the waitress{aspositive} remembers me and is very friendly she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd{aspositive}
diner food{asnegative} at bistro prices{asnegative} is a bummer
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food{aspositive} it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation
the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland
the portions{aspositive} are large and the servers{aspositive} always surprise us with a different starter{aspositive}
delicious bagels{aspositive} especially when right out of the oven
all the food{aspositive} was hot tasty
this is one great place to eat pizza{aspositive} more out but not a good place for take out pizza{asnegative}
our server{aspositive} was very helpful and friendly
try green curry with vegetables{aspositive}
first of all this place{asnegative} is *not* romantic as claimed by citysearch's editorial review
the second you walk through the heavy vault like door{asneutral} with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime
much more reasonably priced{aspositive} too
the food{asnegative} was not very tasty the portioins{asnegative} were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant
why make a reservation{asnegative} if you aren't going to keep it
the pad thai{aspositive} is excellent here as well
i do not recommend lunch specials{asnegative} just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant
we parked on the block of nina's the place{aspositive} looked nice with people obviously enjoying their pizzas{aspositive}
the food{asneutral} is o k but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant
we had the pot stickers{aspositive} which were great and a tempura dish{aspositive} that was great
i think the stuff{aspositive} was better than disney
while the $20 entree range{aspositive} is not overly expensive in new york city there is definitely better food{asnegative} in that range and so sapphire despite it's lovely atmosphere{aspositive} will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return
orsay is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food{aspositive} in nyc
well their deliveries{asnegative} take for ever and the food{asnegative} is usually cold
the staff{aspositive} is no nonsense
and really large portions{aspositive}
this is a great thai restaurant with a very friendly staff{aspositive}
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer{asnegative} and it was off flavor
we went here for lunch{asneutral} a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food{aspositive}
i recommend the garlic shrimp{aspositive} okra bindi{aspositive} and anything with lamb{aspositive}
as we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter{asneutral} we're not in a hurry
the menu{aspositive} was impressive with selections ranging from a burger{asneutral} to steak{asneutral} to escargot{asneutral}
in fact two people could really share one plate{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is great and authentic
good for casual dinner{aspositive} with jeans and sneakers
anyway the food{aspositive} is good the price{aspositive} is right and they have a decent wine list{aspositive}
prices{asnegative} are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala{aspositive} is quite good
this place has many different styles of pizza{aspositive} and they are all amazing
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look{asnegative}
the food{asnegative} was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions{asnegative} tiny
but the coconut rice{aspositive} was good
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer{asneutral}
the food{aspositive} was great
pair you food{asneutral} with the excellent beers on tap{aspositive} or their well priced{aspositive} wine list{aspositive}
if you like your music{asnegative} blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun{asnegative} then you'll love it here
all of my co workers stated that the food{aspositive} was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place
metrazur has a beautiful spot{aspositive} overlooking the main terminal
friendly staff{aspositive} that actually lets you enjoy your meal{aspositive} and the company you're with
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table{aspositive} quickly
quality of food{aspositive} is excellent and price{aspositive} is cheap stick to pork{aspositive} fish{aspositive} chicken{aspositive} lamb{aspositive} and vegetables{aspositive}
the place{asnegative} is a little tight and on a cold day the seating{asnegative} by the entranceway can be pretty drafty
the appetizing{aspositive} is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price{aspositive} if bought by the pound
but they were too big for the bun{asneutral}
the food{aspositive} is fresh delicious and reasonably priced{aspositive}
raga stands out with an interesting fusion of french and indian cooking{aspositive}
a few tips skip the turnip cake{asnegative} roast pork buns{asnegative} and egg custards{asnegative}
the bagels{aspositive} are fabulous
oh yes and they lie on the phone claiming they have seating in the garden{asneutral} then of course the seats{asneutral} are not available
although they do the typical what kind of water{asneutral} would you like questions the service{aspositive} was good and overall very relaxing to place{aspositive} to eat
the food{aspositive} was very good a great deal and the place{aspositive} its self was great
the food options{aspositive} rule
a great choice at any cost{aspositive} and a great deal
we ate here in march 2006 and ordered the pre theatre 3 course dinner{asneutral} with wine flight{asneutral}
probably much busier for lunch{asneutral} it's seldom crowded for dinner{asneutral} too close to downtown
their calzones{asnegative} are horrific bad vomit inducing yuck
it takes forever to get a drink{asneutral} and they almost always forget to bring something although they dont forget to charge you for it
the place{aspositive} itself is beautiful the bar scene{aspositive} seems to be happening
saturday nov 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff{aspositive} was amazing to accomodate us
good spreads{aspositive} great beverage selections{aspositive} and bagels{aspositive} really tasty
first the waiter{asnegative} who served{asnegative} us neglected to fill us in on the specials{aspositive} which i would have chosen had i known about them
also top the meal{asneutral} with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu{aspositive}
check out the secret back room{aspositive}
it's also attached to angel's share which is a cool more romantic bar{aspositive}
authentic food{aspositive} and they have real service{aspositive} not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door
stick to the gulab jamun{aspositive}
i am amazed by the poor reviews i find this place to be standout italian in an area flooded with italian great prices{aspositive} great atmosphere{aspositive} good service{aspositive} and a wonderful wine list{aspositive}
i was back to back with the diner{asneutral} at the table{asnegative} behind me and wait staff{asnegative} had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal{aspositive} in a beautiful room{aspositive}
we've only eaten in the restaurant once but we have ordered many times for dinner{asneutral}
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly{aspositive} in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is great and reasonably priced{aspositive}
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine{aspositive}
over the years the host{aspositive} vittorio and his crew{aspositive} have always treated me as family although with all the business this not so little gem does it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not so frequent visitor
the restuarant itself is not large but seems to have several round tables{aspositive} to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese{aspositive}
my husband said he could've eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries{aspositive} were the best he has had
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late raucus dinner{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is delicious from the specials{aspositive} to the regular menu fare{aspositive} the dishes{aspositive} are never a disappointment
prices{asneutral} are in line
the combination of fresh tomato sauce{aspositive} fresh mozz cheese{aspositive} basil{aspositive} and the dough{aspositive} they make with imported flour{aspositive} makes this is one of the better pizza{aspositive} in ny
the food{aspositive} is prepared quickly and efficiently
for all of you new to indian food{aspositive} try the paneer roll{aspositive} it is a piece of heaven
the food{aspositive} looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates{aspositive}
both the fresh mozzerella slices{aspositive} and the plain cheese slice{aspositive} are phenomenal
the food{asnegative} is terrible and overall i would have to say avoid at all costs
unfortunately the food{asnegative} was not something to get worked up about
it's constantly open catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st so there's more turnover with the food{aspositive} than you'd expect i e surprisingly fresh
i had filet mignon with garlic mash{asneutral}
i went at 6 00 pm specifically for the pre theater menu{aspositive} $19 95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre{aspositive} steak frites{aspositive} creme brulee{aspositive} and it was marvelous
the waitstaff{aspositive} were attentive polite and helpful an impressive feat in such close quarters
the bread{aspositive} at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more the pizza{aspositive} is delicious and comes in personal sizes however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula{asneutral} is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top{asneutral} like a salad{asneutral}
yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it
the large selection of bruschettas{aspositive} paninis{aspositive} tramezzinis{aspositive} keep the palate from stagnating
have always found that the waiters{aspositive} will go out of their way to be helpful despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners{asneutral}
while this isn't classical restaurant fare the chef{aspositive} has given new life to an old cuisine{asneutral} with some really innovative and tasty dishes{aspositive} that are genuinely indian{aspositive} without being heavy or same old restaurant burn outs
the owner{aspositive} truly caters to all your needs
he takes real pride in his food{aspositive} and his business
so if you want a nice enjoyable meal{aspositive} at montparnasse go early for the pre theater prix fixe{aspositive}
over the years it has always provided a pleasurable dining{aspositive} experience with quality food{aspositive} and wine{aspositive}
the photobook menu{aspositive} was a cute touch certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken{asneutral} pork chop{asneutral} and noodle dishes{asneutral} that we all ordered
i cannot imagine better indian food{aspositive} in all of the city
great romantic place{aspositive} for a date try to get the corner booth table{aspositive} for a little privacy{aspositive} and to sit close
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich{asneutral} and the manager{asnegative} basically told me to take my business elsewhere
very good breads{aspositive} as well
if this happens just ask for real naan{asneutral}
we were fans of the half price saturday night option{aspositive} until some inedible squid{asnegative} during a recent visit
pizza{aspositive} is terrific as is homemade pasta{aspositive}
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money{aspositive}
example is the soup{aspositive} which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms{aspositive} where $12 for about 1oz
service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal
there are other people waiting{asnegative}
from beginning appetizers{aspositive} the scallops{aspositive} were incredible to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet{aspositive} we were delighted by the taste{aspositive} sensations
consistently good japanese tapas{aspositive}
my goodness everything from the fish{aspositive} to the rice{aspositive} to the seaweed{aspositive} was absolutely amazing
the dishes{aspositive} offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages{aspositive} sardines with biscuits{aspositive} large whole shrimp{aspositive} to the amazing pistachio ice cream{aspositive} the best and freshest i've ever had
the food{aspositive} is reliable and the price{asneutral} is moderate
while the ambiance{aspositive} and atmosphere{aspositive} were great the food{asnegative} and service{asnegative} could have been a lot better
the server{aspositive} was really cool and served{aspositive} us our food{asneutral} and drinks{asneutral} with a smile
we were in search of food{asneutral} and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street
planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi{aspositive} which is great the thai food{aspositive} is excellent too
very excited to hear that short term chef{asnegative} jason narone has moved on he truly was a low point of their sterling track record
i had to share my table{asnegative} with a loud group of kids and the service{asnegative} was rude an unattentive
the sauce on the pizza{aspositive} is sooo good with garlic{aspositive} and fresh tomatoes{aspositive} and they don't skimp
we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating{aspositive} perfect since i had my yorkie with me
my husband had the mesclun{aspositive} salmon{aspositive} and ice cream{aspositive} and he enjoyed all 3 courses{aspositive}
we were told that the wait{asneutral} was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8 00 pm curtain call
the food{aspositive} is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place{asnegative} to go
super friendly and knowledgable staff{aspositive} fabulous bistro fare{aspositive} and a wonderful jazz brunch{aspositive} with great live jazz{aspositive} the chilaquiles{aspositive} were awesome
the prices{aspositive} were fantastic
still any quibbles about the bill were off set by the pour your own measures of liquers{aspositive} which were courtesey of the house
the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service{asneutral} industry i understood they were busy
it's not mind blowing but to me thai food{asneutral} never is and never will be
food{aspositive} was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection though i wish the pork belly{asnegative} that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat{asnegative} was more of a melt in your mouth experience
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food{aspositive} was fine if not good
it is kinda nosiy and the tables{asnegative} are close together but it's still a beautiful place{aspositive} to enjoy a nice dinner{aspositive}
i love the fact that the pizza{aspositive} tastes so good and is so cheap
nicky the nose at the bar{asneutral} is a treat
service{aspositive} was prompt friendly and great
i haven't eat a lamb chop{aspositive} as delicious as that the salads{aspositive} are really nice dressed with lemon{aspositive} and extra virgnin olive oil{aspositive}
the sushi{asnegative} was awful
you can get an excellent meal{aspositive} at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes{aspositive} here
the pastrami sandwich{aspositive} was like buttah and with pickles{aspositive} and an icy cold beer{aspositive} to wash it down it was a pleasurable experience
the plain pizza{asnegative} was soggy and the creative wild mushroom third generation fornini pizza{aspositive} we had was drenched with truffle oil{asneutral} in the middle again making it soggy and nothingon the rest
late nite omelletes{asnegative} are not good here there is no variety
after all that they complained to me about the small tip{asnegative}
it's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch{aspositive} or dinner{aspositive}
behind this counter{asnegative} two men are squeezed in
whenever you need a sushi fix{aspositive} mizu will be there with quality fish{aspositive} and great service{aspositive}
our waitress{aspositive} was sweet and accomodating not overbearing
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table{asnegative} even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh{asneutral} on them
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food{asnegative} from there
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing
despite a slightly limited menu{asnegative} everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art{aspositive}
the outdoor atmosphere{aspositive} of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful
a large is $20 and toppings{asneutral} are about $3 each
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza{aspositive} restaurant anywhere
add to that great service{aspositive} and great food{aspositive} at a reasonable price{aspositive} and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
for many people this may not seem like aunthentic thai food{asnegative} because most places in nyc arent quite authentic
growing up in ny i have eaten my share of bagels{asneutral}
oh don't even let me start with how expensive the bills{asnegative} were
the scallion pancakes{asneutral} and fried dumplings{asneutral} were nothing out of the ordinary
all the appetizers{aspositive} and salads{aspositive} were fabulous the steak{aspositive} was mouth watering and the pasta{aspositive} was delicious
besides having the table{asnegative} we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated we were served{asnegative} dishes{asnegative} we hadn't ordered three times received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table{asnegative} had been served{asnegative} and that order was undercooked and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill{asnegative}
service{aspositive} is top notch
the food{asnegative} now is inconsistent
you can also special order any kind of dumpling{aspositive} etc
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer{asneutral}
be careful before you request extra spice{asneutral}
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad{aspositive}
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking{asnegative} in the foods{asnegative}
and the tom kha soup{asnegative} was pathetic
i started out with a bombay beer{aspositive} which was big enough for two
the decor{aspositive} is vibrant and eye pleasing with several semi private boths{aspositive} on the right side of the dining hall{aspositive} which are great for a date
service{aspositive} was quick
drawbacks service{asnegative} is slow and they don't toast
went there for an office lunch{asneutral}
the sweet lassi{aspositive} was excellent as was the lamb chettinad{aspositive} and the garlic naan{aspositive} but the rasamalai{asnegative} was forgettable
we've been following chef{aspositive} lyle's food{aspositive} around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic his innovations with bistro fare{aspositive} have made us return and return
the best thing i tasted were the lambchops{aspositive}
the spicy tuna{aspositive} and salmon{aspositive} are the best we've ever had
even though its good seafood{aspositive} the prices{asnegative} are too high
in addition the food{aspositive} is very good and the prices{aspositive} are reasonable
upon entering we were greeted by the owners{aspositive} steven and frederick who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts{aspositive}
been going here since it opened have seen the quality value{asnegative} decrease considerably
meat dishes{asneutral} now adorn the selections although there's still a large number of vegetarian friendly choices{aspositive}
reasonable prices{aspositive}
they bring service{aspositive} up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche{aspositive} to all tables{aspositive} and gave us a small dessert{aspositive} for our celebration
try the crunchy tuna{aspositive} it is to die for
it won't break the bank but i also wouldnt come back for the food{asnegative}
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi{aspositive} restaurants in the city
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment{aspositive} and all kinds of disney type special effects{aspositive}
if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi{aspositive} go here if you're looking for interesting combinations try sushi{aspositive} of gari's east side
no refills on fountain drinks{asnegative} though
wow over 100 beers{aspositive} to choose from
be careful of portions{aspositive} they're huge
the steak tartare{aspositive} is a great bet they fix it for you at the table
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt{asnegative} that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal
great for large groups and celebrations our super happy waiter{aspositive} was the entertainment of the evening
did i mention the wine{asneutral}
plus on wednesday nights the house wine{aspositive} is unlimited
like saying her bread{asnegative} comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan
the dim sum servings{asneutral} here are a bit larger than i'm used to
however in the summer of 2003 it seems the management{asneutral} has changed and the great big door{aspositive} has been replaced for a glass front{asnegative} ridding itself of the dark romantic getup
we won't go to this place again for a good meal{asnegative}
barbecued codfish{aspositive} was gorgeously moist as if poached yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning{asnegative} a spice rub{asnegative} might have overwhelmed however herb mix{asnegative} or other sauce{asnegative} would have done much to enhance
after dinner{asneutral} take your date to the huge dance floor{aspositive} probably one of the biggest you'll see in ny
taj mahal offeres gret value{aspositive} and great food{aspositive}
has the chef{asneutral} and owner{asneutral} changed
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner{aspositive} at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience
but don't ever order bacon{asnegative} late at nite either platter{asnegative} or in sandwiches{asnegative} for that matter don't from any take out place as it is from the morning frying{asnegative} turns out hard almost like bacos{asnegative} hurt my molars
outstanding bagels{aspositive} but you get what you pay for
pizza{aspositive} the only pizza{aspositive} in nyc that should not have additional toppings{asneutral} the crust{aspositive} tastes like the best freshly baked bread{aspositive}
i found it on a cold night the perfect spot{aspositive} to warm up
they even have a section in the menu{asnegative} called american chinese food{asnegative}
service{aspositive} was warm and attentive beef carpaachio{aspositive} was exellent huge portion{aspositive} and pasta{aspositive} was fresh and well prepared
kalbi{asneutral} and nebbiolo{asneutral} do work together
best italian food{aspositive} i ever had and being italian that means alot
i will recommend scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful italian food{aspositive}
located{aspositive} at the end of a magnificent block
looking around i saw a room{asneutral} full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal{aspositive} in a real restaurant not a clubhouse{asnegative} of the fabulous trying to be seen
they don't walk around with the trays of dim sum{asneutral}
great bar{aspositive} most gorgeous bartenders{aspositive} you've ever seen specifically the blond lady
we were planning to get dessert{asneutral} but the waitress{asnegative} basically through the bill{asneutral} at us before we had a chance to order
i really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff{aspositive} gives to the food{aspositive}
they came out over cooked and the cheese{asnegative} was almost non existant
i had a terrific meal{aspositive} and our server{aspositive} guided us toward a very nice wine{aspositive} in our price range{aspositive} instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced{asneutral} wine{asnegative} that wasn't as good
the svc{asnegative} can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must
the food{aspositive} is good especially their more basic dishes{aspositive} and the drinks{aspositive} are delicious
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish{aspositive}
i had the tuna tartare{aspositive} with sake{aspositive} mushroom ravioli{aspositive} with pinot noir{aspositive} and the chocolate sampler{aspositive} with a dessert wine{aspositive} for $49
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service{aspositive}
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i don't have to deal with crowds{asnegative} or lines{asnegative}
pizza{aspositive} here is consistently good
we had a great tiem watching the shows{aspositive} and characters{aspositive} and ar food{aspositive} was just what we were looking for
after 2 tries by the waiter{asnegative} to take it away we hadn't even looked at it yet we had full beers{asneutral} yet to drink the manager{asnegative} approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations{aspositive}
wouldn't recomend it for dinner{asnegative}
sauce{asnegative} was watery and the food{asnegative} didn't have much flavor{asnegative}
my husband and i enjoy sangria{aspositive}
but after last night spice grill is the only place i'm eating indian cuisine{aspositive}
we both opted for a pasta dish{aspositive} and they were served{aspositive} timely and fresh
first the wrong bread{asnegative} came out with the appetizer{asneutral} then when i tried to order a second glass of wine{asneutral} for my main course{asneutral}
not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood{aspositive} and has great food{aspositive}
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food{aspositive} this is one of the best spots
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter{asnegative}
make reservations{asnegative} but expect to be delayed 15 20 minutes as the hosting staff{asnegative} was having difficulty seating{asnegative} guests who arrived with a reservation{asneutral} because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square
the food{aspositive} was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes{aspositive}
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials{asnegative} or fresh ingredients{asnegative} which to me is necessary for good thai{asneutral}
other apetizers{asneutral} and food{asneutral}
the noodle and rices dishes{aspositive} taste great
the food{aspositive} as good as ever
the crust{aspositive} is thin the ingredients{aspositive} are fresh and the staff{aspositive} is friendly
also a little more expensive than your average bagel{asneutral} place
the food{asnegative} was undercooked the sauce{asnegative} watery and the vegetables{asnegative} raw
and the fried clams{aspositive} had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating
the sauces{asnegative} used are also not that exciting
the secret is the lunch menu{aspositive} which offers a complimentary appetizer{aspositive} with every entree{aspositive} ordered
the rice{asnegative} was poor quality{asnegative} and was cooked{asnegative} so badly it was hard
we had champagne{aspositive} and caviar{aspositive} and felt like princesses
the shrimp scampi{aspositive} was excellent and the antipasti{aspositive} were plentiful
when my dessert{asneutral} came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter{aspositive} must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
i got the $10 10 piece dim sum combo{aspositive} every bite of which was great
there is also very limited seating{asnegative} and there can be a substantial wait{asnegative} in getting food{asneutral} at peak times
if it's just a quick martini{asneutral} at the bar{asneutral} which i recommend jeffery's or a mind blowing roast chicken{aspositive} go to village
there was a long wait{asnegative} for a table{asneutral} outside but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table{aspositive} was very nice
the prices{aspositive} are wonderfully low
if you like spicy food{asneutral} get the chicken vindaloo{asneutral}
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials{aspositive}
so much more than the usual bar food{aspositive} go there to enjoy the menu{aspositive} while sampling one of their hand crafted beers{aspositive}
no free drink{asneutral}
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food{aspositive} and service{aspositive} was excellent
while they keep the capex{aspositive} to a minimum they do put some cash into the bagels{asneutral} because they among the best in the city
the two star chefs{asneutral} left quite some time ago to open their own place
don't waste money on decor{asneutral}
they also have a back garden{aspositive} open in the summer cute and french with outdoor seating{aspositive} what more could you ask for
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri{asneutral}
given the incredible architecture{aspositive} surrounding it this place{asnegative} has no character
i'd call it an 'italian dinner{asneutral}
while the place{asnegative} is not a hotspot hangout the drinks{aspositive} are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck
have frequented 'ino for several years and the food{aspositive} remains excellent
their eggplant{aspositive} is so delicate sweet tender
each bite of food{aspositive} at kai was indeed delicious fresh and elegant
all the food{aspositive} was excellent considering the quality of food{aspositive} in most moderately priced{asneutral} restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it
my friend got the mushroom pizza{aspositive} which tasted better
i had the cod with paella{asnegative} spicy and very filling i'm a big eater and could only eat half while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips{asnegative} again a big serving{asnegative} at least 5 pieces of fish{asneutral} and a basketful of fries{asneutral}
it's a shame that a nice convenient place{aspositive} like the pink pony can be so ruined by lousy service{asnegative}
you should pass on the calamari{asnegative}
the porcini mushroom pasta special{asnegative} was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle{asnegative}
try the spicy wontons{aspositive} and the salt pepper shrimps{aspositive}
the food portions{aspositive} are really large
the fries{aspositive} are yummy
friendly and informative staff{aspositive} very attentive and prompt raw bar service{aspositive}
best taiwanese food{aspositive} in ny
this place is a great stop for great food{aspositive}
all the pastas{aspositive} are fantastic and the homemade lasagna{aspositive} is some of the best that i have had in the city
we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu{asneutral} and we left a 10 percent tip{aspositive} which was generous i feel
and the prices{asnegative} were way to high for what you get
the staff{asnegative} ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there
yet paired with such rude service{asnegative} would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there
the in house lady dj{aspositive} on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music{aspositive} and moreover takes requests
i need at least three rolls{asneutral} to be full and that's at least $14 00
great wine list{aspositive} reasonably priced{aspositive} sara
the hot dogs{asnegative} were cold in the middle and the buns{asnegative} were stale
while the food{aspositive} was excellent it wasn't cheap though not extremely expensive either
beef noodle soup{aspositive} is good as well
delivery service{aspositive} is great too
the food{aspositive} dazzling flavors{aspositive} overwhelm the palate truly embracing the beauty of authentic thai cuisine{aspositive}
i recieved prompt service{aspositive} with a smile
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza{asnegative} like vt's
the place{aspositive} was quiet and delightful
the food{aspositive} is a diamond in rough the food{aspositive} is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs{aspositive} and tomatoes{aspositive}
as much as i like the food{aspositive} there i can't bring myself to go back
it looked like shredded cheese{asnegative} partly done still in strips
the prices{aspositive} and ambience{aspositive} are especially great considering it's in the west village
the soup{aspositive} is pretty good too
it is so easy to get a reservation{aspositive} at a top place in nyc with a week's notice
i have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables{aspositive} or a mushroom consomme{aspositive} and this chef{aspositive} accomplishes without fats
if you go to roth's try to be served{aspositive} by mike he is great
not the food{asneutral} not the ambiance{asneutral} not the service{asneutral} i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait the wait staff{asnegative} are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out
i always get the shabu shabu dinner{asneutral} and the beef{aspositive} is always fresh
the pizza{asnegative} was delivered cold and the cheese{asnegative} wasn't even fully melted
we were very surprised by how good the food{aspositive} was on our first visit here on a sunday night
nha trang while being notorious for utter lack of comfort{asnegative} and decor{asnegative} horribly slow wait staff{asnegative} and horribly quick meals{asnegative} is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to the pho{aspositive} is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables{aspositive}
on the other hand if you are not fooled easily you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service{asneutral} and ambiance{asneutral} that is on par with alain ducasse and food{asnegative} that will outshine in presentaion{asnegative} taste{asnegative} choice{asnegative} quality{asnegative} and quantity{asnegative}
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene{aspositive} but also the promise of the pizza place at 3am
if i could rate the people{aspositive} this place would be off the charts unfortunately the pizza{asnegative} sorry not the best in nyc
the food{aspositive} is amazing
having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit but the food{aspositive} was tasty and spicy sans the oil{asneutral} that comes floating along at similar venues
the portions{asnegative} are now very small the sauces{asnegative} are overly ambitious usually inedible while the service{aspositive} is still good the restaurant due to its popularity seems frantic
for the price{aspositive} you cannot eat this well in manhattan
the owner{aspositive} is very friendly and a great guy go try his pizza{aspositive} you'll like it
the atmosphere{aspositive} is great
with so many good restaurants on the uws i don't need overpriced food{asnegative} absurdly arrogant wait staff{asnegative} who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner{asnegative} clumsy service{asnegative} and management{asnegative} that doesn't care
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin{aspositive} which was heavenly at sushi rose
the service{asnegative} is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food{aspositive} arrives
the bruscetta{asnegative} is a bit soggy but the salads{aspositive} were fresh included a nice mix of greens{aspositive} not iceberg{asneutral} all dishes{aspositive} are served{aspositive} piping hot from the kitchen
the atmosphere{asneutral} isn't the greatest but i suppose that's how they keep the prices{aspositive} down
the pickles{aspositive} were great addition
if your favorite chinese food{asneutral} is general tao chicken{asnegative} then this is not your place
you must try the shrimp appetizers{aspositive}
not only is the cuisine{aspositive} the best around the service{aspositive} has always been attentive and charming
the production is a symphony alot of fun to experience the food{aspositive} sublime for the most part
waiters{asnegative} tend to forget drinks{asneutral} completely food portions{asnegative} are so tiny two people have trouble sharing one entree{asnegative}
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy s food is expensive but it's new york
the cold appetizer dishes{aspositive} taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan
the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar{asneutral} for about 20 minutes before we were seated
interesting selection good wines{aspositive} service{aspositive} fine fun decor{aspositive}
any if you have a reservation{aspositive} you'll wait for max 5 minutes so have a drink{asneutral} at the bar{asneutral}
whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle{aspositive} or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar{aspositive} you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
the food{asneutral} at this place is 'gourmet' indian cuisine{asneutral}
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like bar{asnegative} or pub{asnegative}
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich{aspositive} katz's has a charm about it
however looking at the table next to ours we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza{aspositive} which looked perrrrrrrrrfect
priced{asnegative} at upper intermediate range
the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced
if you live in new york city you'll find better food{asnegative} at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount{asnegative}
try the olive cream cheese{aspositive} or the lox spread{aspositive} on a whole wheat everything bagel{asneutral}
they didn't disappoint service{aspositive} from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server{aspositive} per table{asneutral}
i don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music{asnegative} till three in the morning every weekend during the summer
the rice to fish ration{aspositive} was also good they didn't try to overpack the rice{aspositive}
they used shredded cheese{asneutral} on top
the food{aspositive} is great and they have a good selecion of wines{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive}
the only positive was the wait staff{aspositive} which was prompt knowledgable and likeable
i couldn't reccommend their godmother pizza{aspositive} any higher
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes{aspositive} were great
i was very impressed by this low key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine{aspositive}
for the location{asneutral} the prices{aspositive} are very reasonable
the food{asneutral} is okay and the prices{asneutral} here are mediocre
my friend's food{asnegative} was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like and look like
i ordered the crab cocktail{asnegative} and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction{asneutral} where all you could taste was the lime{asneutral}
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items{aspositive} when i don't have to rush off to a show
we have been to this place many times and always have great food{aspositive} wine{aspositive} and service{aspositive}
hopefully next time i will save room for dessert{asneutral}
not a typical pizza joint but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner{aspositive}
the corned beef{aspositive} was tender and melted in my mouth
the best chicken pad tai{aspositive} i've ever had
$20 for all you can eat sushi{asneutral} cannot be beaten
haru serves very fresh fish{aspositive} has a trendy modern ambiance{aspositive} prime location{aspositive} on park avenue south and friendly service{aspositive}
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating{aspositive} in the warmer months
very romantic fires i've literally spent hours at lanterna drinking wine{aspositive} from their extensive wine{aspositive} and enjoying the ambience{aspositive}
we got a little tipsy from the sake{asneutral} but isn't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about
i almost wanted to write a bad review so no one would ever go here and i could have all the dumplings{aspositive} to myself
always a nice crowd{aspositive} but never loud
my turkey burger{asnegative} was not cooked at all my friends salmon{asnegative} was completely raw
the service is spotty sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there
decor{asneutral} is minimalist and clean nothing to distract or commend
his drinks{aspositive} are very inventive delicious and classy
great food{aspositive} great prices{aspositive} great service{aspositive}
this isn't your corner chinese food{asneutral} takeout
awsome pizza{aspositive} especially the margheritta{aspositive} slice
this place{aspositive} however has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food{aspositive} is still above average
try ordering from the regular menu{aspositive} then you would not regret
told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table{asnegative} was reserved
uni from maine vs california sea vs freshwater eel{asneutral} to get a good taste comparison
we started with lox{aspositive} and mussels{aspositive} the best ive ever had ever and had the cod{asneutral} and trout{asneutral} for dinner{asneutral}
the crispy chicken{asnegative} wasn't for us though
food{aspositive} is great
i recommend the meatballs{aspositive} and caprese salad{aspositive} and the beans on toast{aspositive} were a wonderful start to the meal{asneutral}
this place{asnegative} is incredibly tiny
i didn't complain i liked the atmosphere{aspositive} so much
in reality to maximize potential diners{asneutral} they were still taking phone reservations{asnegative} and reallocating tables{asnegative} of those waiting{asnegative} in the lobby{asneutral}
the wine{aspositive} is always good the tapas{aspositive} are always yummy especially with the warm pita bread{aspositive}
but when you are seated the waitresses{aspositive} are great they explain everything on the menu{asneutral} and the price{aspositive} of the food{asneutral} is really cheap for the service{aspositive} you get
i've been to several places for dim sum{asnegative} and this has got to be the worst
the freshest best variety{aspositive} and the fastest delivery{aspositive}
go to volare for 1st class service{aspositive} and terrific food{aspositive}
it's super trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat{asneutral} so it seems that customer service{aspositive} has been deemed not of the essence
dinner{asnegative} took almost 4 hours without any lag time
the people{asnegative} in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud
the sandwiches{asnegative} are dry tasteless and way overpriced
price{aspositive} no more than a jersey deli but way better
the fried rice{aspositive} is really good too
we were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff{aspositive} especially the manager{aspositive} tony gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections{aspositive}
made my dining experience{asnegative} uncomfortable
still stay away the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves{asnegative} eventhough they were there much longer
i was with a party of 7 close but not next the the front doors{asneutral} and we were eating with our coats on
a very inviting restaurant with friendly service{aspositive}
the back garden sitting area{aspositive} is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden{aspositive}
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches{asneutral} at katz' deli or mexican food{asneutral} which is supplied by capable restaurants
the drinks{aspositive} are always welll made and wine selection{asneutral} is fairly priced{aspositive}
we also had shared a house salad{aspositive} that was fresh
the ceiling{aspositive} is amazing
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check{asneutral} was given to our table{asneutral} by knocking over a glass of water{asneutral}
not a small feat for good french food{aspositive} in the area
the space{asnegative} is a bit too small for live music{asneutral} so on jazz nights{asneutral} it can be loud and cramped
food{aspositive} was average but tasty
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment{aspositive}
the entree{asnegative} was bland and small dessert{asnegative} was not inspired
the staff{aspositive} was the friendliest that have seen in new york
with the exception of our lemon salad{asnegative} that had so much pepper{asnegative} on it that our eyes started watering the food{asneutral} here was decent not great
the pad thai lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but i've had better thai food{asneutral} in less asthetically pleasing places{asnegative}
delicious food{aspositive} at a great price{aspositive} but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door{asneutral}
my picks guizhou chicken{aspositive} fish with hot bean source{aspositive} fish fillet in spicy source{aspositive} special menu{aspositive}
overall i'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices{aspositive} are quite decent but then again its chinatown
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen{aspositive} is part of the charm
pizza{asnegative} was a little soggy
the food{aspositive} inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat{aspositive} such as bhelpuri{aspositive} sevpuri{aspositive} and samosa chaats{aspositive} as well as other great indian appetizers{aspositive}
the singapore mai fun{asnegative} had no curry flavor{asnegative} whatsoever
the only problem is that the manager{asnegative} is a complete incompetent
the wine list{aspositive} is interesting and has many good values
i'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food{asnegative}
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location{asneutral}
definite go if you're used to good indian restaurant food{aspositive} from abroad
thr at moshphere{aspositive} is compact modern yet cozy
by far the best pizza{aspositive} in manhattan
decent thai food{aspositive} in cute though a bit dank little nolita hangout but service{asnegative} terrible
the waiter{asnegative} actually poured water{asneutral} on my hand and walked away
the food{aspositive} is mostly made from scratch fresh and well prepared
worse of all $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill{asnegative}
no more reservations{aspositive} expensive tips{aspositive} and annoying stuff{aspositive}
try the sea bass{aspositive}
$20 gets you unlimited sushi{aspositive} of a very high quality{aspositive} i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places{aspositive} in the us that he has been to
sushi{asneutral} wasn't anything spectacular for the price{asnegative}
during our meal{asneutral} the management{aspositive} came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks{asneutral}
but they don't have a toaster{asnegative} which is strange
so for good food{aspositive} i'd recommend it but not for a fun night out
the menu choices{asneutral} are similar but the taste{asnegative} lacked more flavor{asnegative} than it looked
a must for all the dosa{aspositive} lovers
the portions{aspositive} are huge so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer{asneutral} and entree{asneutral} per person for two people
the appetizers{asneutral} are just ok and the main courses{asnegative} were decidedly subpar
someone else recommended the dessert{asnegative} we also left that
the exotic food{aspositive} is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations
the staff{aspositive} is very attentive and we can almost always get a table{aspositive}
try the mediterranean salad{aspositive} it is a true experience for your taste buds
people{aspositive} are always friendly
the cream cheeses{aspositive} are out of this world and i love that coffee{aspositive}
from the entrees{aspositive} to the sides{aspositive} to the drinks{aspositive} everything was creatively prepared yet still simple
service{aspositive} was prompt and courteous
it was not above ordinary and the beef version{asnegative} had cheap undercooked beef{asnegative}
chance is a small cozy restaurant with a romantic feel to it the decor{aspositive} is great
it was nice and fresh but i can't give it high scores on being authentic thai{asnegative}
got club soda filled with ice no lime{asneutral}
only wine{asneutral} and beer{asneutral} are served{asnegative} but the house varities{aspositive} are actually quite good
this place must have cost{asnegative} the owners{asneutral} afortune to build
oh and the complimentary pudding dessert{aspositive} was just enough yummy
we split a tasty vegetable samosa{aspositive} and the malai tikka wrap{aspositive}
knowledge of the chef{asnegative} and the waitress{asnegative} are below average
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks{asneutral}
decent wine selection{aspositive} too
it saves walking in and waiting{asnegative} for a table{asnegative} in the often noisy crowded bar{asnegative} at dinnertime
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal{aspositive} here
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese{aspositive} and panchetta{aspositive} raddichio{asnegative} was kind of bitter though
disappointing food{asnegative} lousy service{asnegative}
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food{aspositive} and excellent service{aspositive} this is the place
great place to go for a drink{asneutral} too because they have 100 kinds of beer{aspositive}
over price{asnegative} and small portions{asnegative}
meanwhile the bartender{aspositive} continued to pour champagne{asneutral} from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil{aspositive} gratis
the food{aspositive} was well prepared and the service{aspositive} impecable
but their best dish{aspositive} is thh thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp{aspositive} a dish{aspositive} that would cost{aspositive} $23 95 is most places but it is $16 here
good dark atmosphere{aspositive} and the music{aspositive} is a nice touch
my husband said the portions{asnegative} were very small but if my main course{asnegative} was good to eat the portion{aspositive} would've been fine for me
but the thai{asnegative} is definitely not great bland and indistinguished
great for groups great for a date great for early brunch{aspositive} or a nightcap{aspositive}
our friendly server{aspositive} made great food suggestions{aspositive} and also sent both the sommelier{aspositive} and the fromager{aspositive} to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine{asneutral} and cheese{asneutral}
because we didn't have a reservation{asnegative} we could only sit in the back garden{aspositive} but it was great secluded and perfect in nice weather
stuffing yourself with japanese food{asneutral} is a rare thing
while the food{aspositive} was good certainly no il mulino the service{asnegative} was horrendous
service{asnegative} is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category{asnegative}
our family never expected such incredible entertainment{aspositive} in a restaurant
i would recommend reservations{asneutral} on weekends though
great pizza{aspositive} for lunch place
the food was very expensive we spent $160 for lunch{asnegative} for two but extremely tasty
we were a group of 8 and well seved{aspositive}
the signs{aspositive} the specials menus{aspositive} food{aspositive} and even all the waitstaff{aspositive} are all totally japanese
i love their spicy scallop roll{aspositive} and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken{aspositive}
i'm no food{asneutral} critic but i'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years
i noted it was crossed off on the bill{asneutral}
best dish{aspositive} is nori wrapped tuna{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} was absolutely amazing
some servers{asnegative} make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food{asneutral}
an excellent alternative to fast food{asnegative} joints and ordering in but the food{asnegative} was slightly disappointing
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood{aspositive}
the staff{aspositive} is also attentive and friendly
the all you can eat deal{aspositive} is truly amazing here
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish{asnegative} and had to order 5 dishes{asnegative} to get a decent taste{asneutral}
they were such a rip off $8 95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns{asnegative} and not worth trying
all of the pizzas{aspositive} are terrific and the price{aspositive} is even better
it is about food{asnegative} and ambiance{asnegative} and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine
the food{aspositive} was good too
immediately after we paid the waiter{asnegative} took the money and said okay you guys are outta here
the dining room{aspositive} is quietly elegant with no music{aspositive} to shout over how refreshing
admittedly this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish{asneutral} overflowing the plate and thank goodness in my opinion but for simple elegant sushi{aspositive} there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us
the menu{aspositive} seemed to have a wide variety of dishes{aspositive} for seafood{aspositive} lovers and interesting ways of preparing them
the white bean brushetta{aspositive} to start was incredible and the pasta{aspositive} was phenomenal
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats{aspositive}
the menu{asnegative} is nothing like the one on the website
great food{aspositive} great lay out{aspositive} and awesome service{aspositive}
ive asked a cart attendant{asnegative} for a lotus leaf wrapped rice{asneutral} and she replied back rice{asneutral} and just walked away
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated{aspositive} promptly
the wait staff{aspositive} is very freindly they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town
the waitstaff{asnegative} are all very busy it's not outstanding service but i've never been dealt with rudely
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste{aspositive} of the food{aspositive} and the feel{aspositive} of the restaurant is like being back in japan
they have it all great price{aspositive} food{aspositive} and service{aspositive}
the flavors{aspositive} are great and the menu{aspositive} is extensive
the food{aspositive} was amazing the service{aspositive} was so attentive and personable and how about that ambience{aspositive}
this place{aspositive} has the best interior{aspositive} i have seen anywhere in the northside of w'burg and will impress whoever you bring there
the food{aspositive} has been consistant for years and it never lets you down
i found the variety of the sashimi plate{aspositive} to be satisfying fresh and yummy
and forget what you read under me the atmosphere{asneutral} isn't that bad either
we couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress{asnegative} and servants{asnegative} asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time amazing we just sat down
sometimes i get good food{aspositive} and ok service{asneutral}
it's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food{asneutral} noise{asnegative} and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks
after complaining about the chicken dish{asnegative} the manager{asnegative} came over to tell us that no one had ever complained before and that we just didn't know what the dish{asneutral} was supposed to taste like
the food{aspositive} was spicy and delicious
went for a late weekday lunch{asneutral}
bartender{asnegative} was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar{asneutral}
anyways if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food{aspositive} i wouldn't waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari
dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch{aspositive} and buffet{aspositive}
although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier at the same time it doesn't really matter
this was my frist time at cafe st bart's and i must say how delicous the food{aspositive} and the service{aspositive} was
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks{asneutral} and appetizers{asneutral}
great place to grab a hot bagel{aspositive} on the way to work
it's like they took leftover chicken{asnegative} poured oil{asneutral} and sprinkled pepper powder{asneutral} over it the sauce{asnegative} was translucent and red
one would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks{asneutral} instead we got a snobby waiter{asnegative} wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
we actually gave 10% tip{asnegative} which we have never done despite mediocre food{asneutral} and service{asneutral} because we felt totally ripped off
we were looking forward to nice glass of sangria{aspositive} when we arrived
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window{aspositive}
while we enjoyed the food{aspositive} we were highly disappointed by the poor service{asnegative} waiter{asnegative} was not quite competent and slow service{asnegative} and lack of remorse
the service{aspositive} however was a bright flower in a garden
we've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu{aspositive} disappointed
the food{aspositive} is very good too but for the most part it's just regular food{asneutral} nothing special
a touch more jalapeno{aspositive} heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed
tried the pad see ew{asneutral} on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes{aspositive}
we ate out in the back patio{aspositive} which is worth it as it's cool and the music{aspositive} is hear well there
the location{aspositive} is perfect
guacamole+shrimp appetizer{aspositive} was really great we both had the filet{aspositive} very good didn't much like the frites{asnegative} that came with but the filet{aspositive} was so good neither of us cared
the lunch special{aspositive} is an asbolute steal
this food{asneutral} is asian air fusion
nothing fancy but really good food{aspositive} with pretty reasonable price{aspositive}
the chicken pot pie{aspositive} is excpetiona the cheeseburger{aspositive} huge and delictable and the service{aspositive} professional wan warm
while i quite liked the food{aspositive} and the ambience{aspositive} i'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience
once for dinner{asneutral} and once for brunch{asneutral}
not worth the prices{asnegative}
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff{aspositive} was was just fantastic
service{aspositive} was good and food{aspositive} is wonderful
she gets 10 for her excellent service{aspositive} and advice
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal{aspositive}
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods{aspositive} indian included i made friends with this place long ago
and i say snacking{asneutral} because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner{asnegative}
the quality of food{aspositive} at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz{aspositive} makes this place a perfect 10
i have eaten at saul many times the food{aspositive} is always consistently outrageously good
always ask the bartender{asneutral} for the seasonal beer{aspositive}
if your visiting you'll enjoy the ambiance{aspositive} and the fact that it's in time sq
we were on our way back to nj and since i am in ny we figured why not grab some food{asneutral}
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective
service{asneutral} and food{asneutral} is what any one would expect when spending that type of money
love the atmosphere{aspositive} felt like i was in paris
every course{aspositive} was better than the next
the staff{aspositive} is incredibly helpful and attentive
if presentation and service{aspositive} is your thing then this magic show works
apparently the good cook{aspositive} works then
the yellowtail{aspositive} was particularly good as well
i ate clams oreganta{aspositive} and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil{aspositive}
the menu{asnegative} changed portions{asnegative} were even smaller than before a lentil dish{asnegative} was salty beyond edibility a basmati rice dish{asnegative} lacked flavor{asnegative}
spice is sleek modern and cool with a menu{aspositive} that will not hurt your wallet
patroon features a nice cigar bar{aspositive} and has great staff{aspositive}
very affordable and excellent ambient{aspositive}
more important the sushi{aspositive} rivals the best in tokyo
i have never had cheescake{aspositive} like this
bill a little high but worth it
my co workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery{asnegative} only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered
its a go to for dates as well as entertaining{aspositive} out of town guests
why do people rave about the ambience{asnegative}
were meeting up with some friends for a drink{asneutral} at lafayette 161 and happened to walk by thai angel famished
fluke sashimi{aspositive} drizzled with jalapeno lime olive oil{aspositive} the fruit of the oil{aspositive} nicely highlighting the fish{aspositive} sweetness
great sushi{aspositive} experience
if you're looking for a great meal{aspositive} at a decent price{aspositive} go to del frisco's
they charge $6 00 for rice{asnegative}
my steak au poivre{asnegative} was one of the worst i've had
the owner{aspositive} and staff{aspositive} are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance{aspositive}
try the congee{aspositive} and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh{aspositive} a delicious and sweet tasting bread{aspositive}
although the tables{asnegative} may be closely situated the candle light{aspositive} food quality{aspositive} and service{aspositive} overcompensate
the food{aspositive} was delicious and the waiter{aspositive} was incredibly helpful and attentive considering we were the only ones there for the first hour
from the spectacular caviar{aspositive} to the hospitable waitstaff{aspositive} i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food{asnegative} this is simply dull
the place{asnegative} was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food{aspositive} for your money{aspositive}
ambience{aspositive} is delightful service{aspositive} impeccable
service{aspositive} was excellent and the ac{aspositive} worked very well too thank god it was hot
you get the sense that the people{aspositive} there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice
both are delicious the cooks{aspositive} are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand
my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls{aspositive} which had excellent presentation and tasted great
although be warned their dinner menu to sit{asneutral} and take out{asneutral} prices{asneutral} are different
the staff{aspositive} was accomodating the food{aspositive} was absolutely delicious and the place{aspositive} is lovely
my picks are scallion pancake{aspositive} fried with vegetable juice{aspositive} very special and tasty guizhou chicken{aspositive} shredded squid family style{aspositive} one of my personal favorites sichuan spicy soft shell crab{aspositive} shuizhu fish{aspositive} this one is for hardcore sichuan food{asneutral} fans i wouldn't recommend to my american friends as it's very spicy
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables{asnegative} like the spinach mushroom calzone{asnegative}
to celebrate a birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food{asneutral}
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters{asneutral} and a beer{asneutral} or glass of wine{asneutral} for $8
i really liked the noodle dishes{aspositive} at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish{asnegative}
but for whatever reason prices{asnegative} are about twice as high
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service{asnegative} and i thought the food{asnegative} was overated and on the pricey side
great atmoshere{aspositive} and worth every bit
the spicy tuna roll{aspositive} was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura{aspositive} was awesome great appetizer{aspositive} to share
the staff{aspositive} was knowledgeable and full of personality
great staff{aspositive}
only complaint would be that at an average cost{asnegative} of $12 $15 per meal{asneutral} i'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat{asnegative}
to finish off such a delightful dinner{aspositive} experience you must have dessert{aspositive} especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate{aspositive}
the banana tower{aspositive} is an amazing dessert{aspositive} as well
excellent atmosphere{aspositive} delicious dishes{aspositive} good and friendly service{aspositive}
a cool place{aspositive} to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks{aspositive} and desserts{aspositive}
great vibe{aspositive} lots of people
i like mamoun's food{aspositive} as well but side by side kati rolls just produce tastier food{aspositive} hands down
the service{asnegative} is a bit slow but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner{asneutral} the table{aspositive} is yours all night
but that wasn't the icing on the cake{asnegative} a tiramisu{asnegative} that resembled nothing i have ever had
great food{aspositive} and the prices{aspositive} are very reasonable
wine list is not huge but def well selected
a cool bar{aspositive} with great food{aspositive} and tons of excellent beer{aspositive}
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials{aspositive}
the ambience{aspositive} is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service{aspositive}
fresh authentic french cuisine{aspositive} in substantial portions{aspositive}
drinks{asnegative} got screwed up she acted put upon
the one vegetarian entree{aspositive} abby's treasure{aspositive} was actually quite a surprise it was delicious and had wintermelon{aspositive} covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables{aspositive}
at 5 dumplings{aspositive} for $1 you just cannot go wrong
but the pizza{asnegative} is way to expensive
and the staff{aspositive} is also young energeic and hot
even better they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre{aspositive} and onglet{aspositive} without burning it to death or overcooking it
service was decent but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices{asnegative} and reputation{aspositive}
we had a wonderful meal{aspositive} at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc
good drink{aspositive}
great food{aspositive} spinach and corn dumplings{aspositive} and massamman curry{aspositive} very friendly and no nonsense service{aspositive} and a clean and funky bathroom{aspositive}
we had a girls' night dinner{asneutral} here for restaurant week
however i was there for a work dinner{asneutral} not long ago when my colleague from london noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling{asnegative}
my chow fun and chow see{asnegative} was really bland and oily
even though i made the reservation{aspositive} at 3pm for the same night through dinnerbroker we were seated{aspositive} at a table{aspositive} with one of the best view
we did notice however that some tables had what looked like pita{asnegative} instead of naan{asnegative}
i didn't take a look at the rest menu{asneutral} but the oysters{aspositive} were fantastic
the grilled cheese{aspositive} at home afterwards was better
the red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside
great service{aspositive} great food{aspositive}
the food is expensive but worth every bite
sometimes i get bad food{asnegative} and bad service{asnegative} sometimes i get good good{aspositive} and bad service{asnegative}
when we were finally seated our waitress{asnegative} came by twice 1 for our order and 2 for our check{asneutral}
in summer eat outside on a terrace{aspositive} another great feature of suan
it's the perfect restaurant for ny life style it got cool design{aspositive} awsome drinks{aspositive} and food{aspositive} and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar{asneutral}
we did have to wait at the bar{asneutral} for approx
if you love seafood{aspositive} you would love this place{aspositive}
good fast service{aspositive}
they charge different prices{asnegative} all the time
i was in love with pongsri on 48th but compared to suan it is slow in service{asnegative} and overpriced
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese{aspositive} and a delicious new summer menu{aspositive} at artisanal last night
it's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere{aspositive} that is extremely cozy and romantic even
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine{asnegative}
in terms of the food{asneutral} itself nothing special we limited ourselves to several appetizers{asneutral}
love the jazz bands{aspositive} on fri and sat
to begin we were told there was a 30 minute wait{asnegative} and started to leave when the hostess{aspositive} offered to call us on our cell phone when the table{aspositive} was ready
the servers{aspositive} give you some sample slices of your order while you wait shortly i might add
the service{asneutral} was ok
when asked about how a certain dish{asneutral} was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonald's every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
don't expect to sit down inside though there are only a few tables{asnegative} and they are always full
the staff{aspositive} is accomodating the ambiance{aspositive} is exciting and yet relaxed and the food{aspositive} is out of this world
the food{aspositive} was delicious i had a halibut special{aspositive} my husband had steak{aspositive} and the service{aspositive} was top notch
the manager{asnegative} claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill{asneutral} which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food{aspositive}
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal{aspositive} on saturday so it was well worth it
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated{aspositive} right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation{asneutral}
we were fast to order the appetizer platter{asneutral} since we were very hungry
the staff{aspositive} are attentive and have smiles on their faces
no dress codes{aspositive} no attitudes{aspositive} plenty of comfort companionship a great place{aspositive} to relax in an always busy midtown
largest and freshest pieces of sushi{aspositive} and delicious
even the pasta{aspositive} is delicious here a rarity in new york pizza restaurants
but when we looked at the menu{asnegative} there weren't a lot of choices most of them were dumplings{asneutral} in the appetizer{asnegative} section
maybe i say so because it looked promising for people who like artery clogging jewish deli food but turns out to be poorly run and awful
after my 3rd time the manager{aspositive} remembered me and treated me like an usual customer
now if they could only get a toaster{asnegative}
when he's not making authentic neapolitan pizza{aspositive} in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms{aspositive} he's visiting the regulars a growing legion and checking on newcomers
wait staff{asnegative} is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie{aspositive} on the uws
the ingredients{aspositive} taste fresher the crust{aspositive} is thinner and crispier the slice{aspositive} is less oily and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe's
fish{aspositive} is so very fresh
the prices{aspositive} were cheap compared to the quality of service{aspositive} and food{aspositive}
top spot in town for vietnamese classics{aspositive} better than places that cost a lot more
less wait time{aspositive} for me
the decor{asnegative} is really blah and not at all hip or happening
having discovered ping's on the internet we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks{aspositive} that greet you as u walk in
it appears to be the owner{asnegative} first venture and it shows
i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza{aspositive} in fornino's blows my families receipies away
we ordered some beef{asnegative} and noodle soup dishes{asnegative} from the thai section of the menu{asnegative} but nothing we got was thai
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses{aspositive} and all of their salads{aspositive} are great
the lobster sandwich{aspositive} is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp{aspositive} is great
the food{aspositive} was authentic
the dim sum{aspositive} is delectable while the prices{aspositive} are quite easy on the wallet
i only tried a simple dish{aspositive} of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce{aspositive} but it actually faired better than most nyc italian joints i've tried similar dishes{asneutral} at
the worst excuse for japanese food{asnegative} i've ever encountered
i ordered a chicken teriyaki dish{asnegative} and found that the chicken{asnegative} was extremely dry
we had reservations{asnegative} at 9pm but was not seated until 10 15pm
we had pam's special fried fish{aspositive} and it was amazing
there is no excuse for such lousy service{asnegative}
my boyfriend had the new england chowder{aspositive} it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque{aspositive}
so a little inconsistency there but either way both pizzas{aspositive} were really good
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi{asneutral} favorites but everything was delicious
not enough wines by the glass{asnegative} either
i had the duck breast special{aspositive} on my last visit and it was incredible
i must say it's a little pricey for the food{asnegative} because it was not as spectacular as the view
these innovators of french indian fusion{aspositive} do a great job of making dishes{aspositive} as interesting as possible while still being accessible
just don't take the seat{asnegative} between the bar{asneutral} and the back half of the restaurant i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there
no gimmicks here the food{aspositive} speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait{aspositive}
my wife had the fried shrimp{aspositive} which are huge and loved it
one should not go to lucky strike for the food{asnegative}
the service{asnegative} is awful the last time i was there and i do mean the last time we were told that they needed our table{asnegative} so we would have to leave
we could only get through an appetizer{asneutral} and cheese fondue{asneutral}
both times we waited well over a half hour for a table{asnegative} even though we had reservations{asnegative}
night without a reservation{asneutral} we had to wait at the bar{asneutral} for a little while but the manager{aspositive} was so nice and made our wait{aspositive} a great experience
try the green curry{aspositive}
we had the scallops{aspositive} as an appetizer{aspositive} and they were delicious and the sauce{aspositive} was wonderful
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation{aspositive} and the service{aspositive} was very quick and professional
you rarely have to wait for a seat{aspositive} and the currys masaman green red{aspositive} are full of flavor{aspositive} and come super spicy if you ask for it
the food{aspositive} there are sastifying
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner{aspositive} and drinks{aspositive}
the bar{aspositive} is very well stocked with interesting beers{aspositive} and well priced{aspositive} wines{aspositive}
last memorial day i tried to make reservations{asnegative} but was told they were closed that weekend interesting but
the food{aspositive} was good
great wine selection{aspositive} gigondas{aspositive} is worth the price{asneutral} and the house champagne{aspositive} is a great value
at night but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury the music{asnegative} playing in the background is also voluminous
i have enjoyed everything i have ever gotten and the fish{aspositive} is so fresh and always prepared in a great way
i particularly love their yellowfun tuna{aspositive} and their mussel selection{aspositive}
i love to visit murrays for my bagel{aspositive} fix
we made early dinner reservations{aspositive} and were thoroughly impressed reminds me of my grandfather its old school italian scenery{aspositive} with lots of fun stuff to admire
the place{aspositive} was nice and calm
cheese plate{aspositive} is a varied delight and great bargain at $10
i could have drank 4 glasses of water{asneutral} and still been parched so watch out
when we sat we got great and fast service{aspositive}
most of the servers{aspositive} are very attentive friendly and quite attractive
service{asneutral} is average
but they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials{aspositive} like the godmother pizza a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual{aspositive}
they forgot a sandwich{asneutral} didn't include plastic forks{asneutral} and didn't include pita{asneutral} with the hummus platter{asneutral}
the steak{aspositive} is good the fish{aspositive} is good and the sushi{aspositive} was surprisingly great
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza{aspositive} place to become overcrowded
the service{asnegative} was poor restaurant poorly lit staff{asnegative} not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald's than this joint
my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails{aspositive} the chill decor{aspositive} and the decent sushi{aspositive}
we ended the dinner{asneutral} with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin{aspositive}
the buffet{aspositive} had a nice selection{aspositive}
waitstaff{aspositive} are very friendly
service{asnegative} was slow had to wait to order and get food{asneutral} although not crowded
will have to return to try the chocolate{aspositive}
the food{asnegative} was below average the service{asnegative} was pathetic there was no ambience{asnegative} at all
i really enjoyed the shows{aspositive} put on by the actors{aspositive}
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel{asneutral}
service{aspositive} was efficient courteous
the miso soup{asnegative} lacked flavor{asnegative} and the fish{asnegative} was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past
they are the best bagels{aspositive} i've had
i've read some of the previews reviews people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience{asneutral} then food{asneutral}
toons has recently been redone so it's now a very attractive space{aspositive}
$160 for 2 filets{asneutral} 2 sides{asneutral} an appetizer{asneutral} and drinks{asneutral}
while the prices{asneutral} are nothing special the portions{aspositive} are huge
its a nice quiet location{aspositive} to go eat a good meal{aspositive} relax be able to talk and have a very good time
we arrived for dinner{asneutral} expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past but that's just it the past
however i think this place is a good hang out spot{aspositive}
the menu{asnegative} is prix fixe{asneutral} so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person but it is well worth itsuperb food{aspositive}
the wine list{aspositive} is extensive and impressive
we had the most wonderful waitress{aspositive}
while the staff{aspositive} at this little bistro is very friendly i have never experienced more incompetency
the quail{aspositive} was fantastic and unique and the pastas{aspositive} were full of flavor{aspositive}
the zucchini{aspositive} and mashed potatoes{aspositive} are a blend of garlic{aspositive} and butter{aspositive} which simply melts in your mouth
the staff{aspositive} is courteous and friendly
decor{aspositive} is nice though service{asnegative} can be spotty
aside from the rushed service{asnegative} we were very impressed with the food{aspositive} and the drinks{aspositive}
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll{aspositive}
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine indian dining experience{aspositive} that is definitely a value for your dollar
and even with it's pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too
this big draw is the all you can sushi{aspositive} here for $19 95
some of the workers{asnegative} ignore me and talk to the female customers other times they've skipped my order{asnegative}
the specials{aspositive} are usually quite good too
they've the best desserts{aspositive} and mixed drinks{aspositive} as well as snack foods{aspositive}
try the chocolate mud cake warmed{aspositive} with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato{aspositive}
really cool stauff{aspositive} inside
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture{aspositive} that made tiffin so attractive the menu{asnegative} has been overhauled
the best burger{aspositive} i have had in the village
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $35 menu{asneutral}
i would have gotten some cole slaw{asneutral} and a knish{asneutral} if my stomach had more space
three of us arrived for dinner{asneutral} about 5 30 on a week night without reservations{asneutral}
the blond wood decor{aspositive} is very soothing the premium sake{aspositive} is excellent and the service{aspositive} is great
there is usually a wait but it is well worth it
your money{asneutral} could easily be better spent elsewhere anywhere
only drawback they won't toast your bagel{asnegative} and they don't make eggs{asnegative} for the bagel{asnegative}
as always we had a great glass of wine{aspositive} while we waited
the wait staff{aspositive} is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she's way cuter than me that b@#$* way
of course this atmosphere{asnegative} is lacking but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel{asneutral} place anyways
service{aspositive} was very good and warm
for dinner{asneutral} i had the chicken tikka masala{asneutral} and some garlic naan{asneutral}
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting{aspositive} for a romantic dinner{aspositive} in nyc
food{aspositive} was good and the view{aspositive} of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went
the food{asnegative} is nothing like its menu description{asnegative}
try the pad se ew{aspositive} or chicken with cashew nuts{aspositive} for a memorable and repeatable experience
it's just o k pizza{asneutral}
the food{asneutral} is decent at best and the ambience well it's a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying
the service{asnegative} was a bit slow but they were very friendly
leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare{aspositive} good specials{aspositive} a warm and lively atmosphere{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other heartland breweries in the city
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu shabu{aspositive}
the food{asnegative} was absolutely horrible
food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh
similar to other indian restaurants they use the dinner special{asneutral} to attract customers at the door
the people with carts of food{asnegative} don't understand you because they don't speak english their job is to give you the delicious food{aspositive} you point at
the crackling calamari salad{aspositive} which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants is crispy and lightly dressed
not the greatest sushi place{asnegative} but excellent for a $19 95 all you can eat
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner{asneutral} here simple contract deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20
the thai ice tea{aspositive} was amazingly smooth and yummy
we've never had any problems with the staff{aspositive} but maybe we've been lucky
drinks{asnegative} way over priced{asnegative}
the main downside to the place is the nazi like guy{asnegative} running it who constantly complains about the noise level{asnegative}
what i didn't like was how the food{asnegative} came right after it was ordered
moderate prices{asneutral}
i think i've had some the best meals{aspositive} of my life at minnow
my biggest complaint was the un tasty food although presented well
most importantly food{aspositive} is excellent
great roofdeck{aspositive} nice group of 30 somethings but no music{asnegative} kind of quiet
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager{aspositive} a bubbly friendly young woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing
however service{asneutral} was as plain as sesame crusted salmon{asneutral} i had
it's great to go for a quick lunch{aspositive} either alone or with a friend
the food{asneutral} was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service{asnegative} that made me vow never to go back
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd{asnegative} and noise{asnegative}
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats{aspositive} and drinks{aspositive} in a beautiful setting{aspositive}
the service{asnegative} was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served{asnegative}
other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced the atmosphere{aspositive} is filled with energy and the beautiful people{aspositive} of course and the food{aspositive} was surprising good
we only ordered desserts{asneutral} and drinks{asneutral} but no refills were offered
waiters are slow but sweet
i have been here a few times for dinner{asneutral} once for brunch{asneutral} and twice for lunch{asneutral}
the real kicker of the menu{asneutral} however is the beef cubes{aspositive} or the chicken with chili and lemon grass{aspositive}
the music{aspositive} is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited
the bread{aspositive} and lamb chops{aspositive} i had before the meal{asneutral} were quite good however
rao's has the best service{aspositive} and atmosphere{aspositive} in nyc
instead ordered an ice cold beer{aspositive} which to me works with indian
they never brought us complimentary noodles{asnegative} ignored repeated requests for sugar{asnegative} and threw our dishes{asnegative} on the table
one of the best chicken tikka masala{aspositive}
excellent dumplings{aspositive} served amid clean chic decor{aspositive}
the kitchen{asnegative} however is almost always slow
the corned beef{aspositive} and pastrami{aspositive} are excellent much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square
cute place{aspositive} nice wait staff{aspositive} but would never go there again
also the hostess{aspositive} called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday unexpected but a truly above and beyond thing to do
people{asnegative} are rude bit again it's new york
the plain slice{aspositive} is great and if you get toppings{aspositive} the whole slice is topped with them not sparsely sprinkled on like some places
service{asnegative} was also horrible and the ambience{asnegative} is not that great
service{aspositive} is great takeout{aspositive} is good too
the pizza{asnegative} is overpriced and soggy
everything is excellent the menu{aspositive} is quite extensive and you eat with a view{aspositive} on both sides of the city
for the quality of food{asnegative} a little too expensive
here's to the fake fish tanks{asnegative} too
its worth the wait though
i've never had bad service{aspositive} and the fish{aspositive} is fresh and delicious
the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band{aspositive} and atmosphere{aspositive} i ordered the lobster cobb salad{asneutral}
we decided to eat in tea room{aspositive} which was small and cute
what an amazing meal{aspositive} and experience
unique apppetizers{aspositive}
the staff{aspositive} has always been attentive and kind and i've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in
it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner{aspositive} at a fine restaurant
also the sandwiches{asnegative} nearing $7 didn't come with anything like chips{asneutral} or a side{asneutral}
the wait{asnegative} here is long for dim sum{asneutral} but if you don't like sharing tables{aspositive} or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere{asneutral} is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative
this place has good potential but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money{asnegative} on indian food{asneutral} you can get everywhere else
everything is always cooked to perfection the service{aspositive} is excellent the decor{aspositive} cool and understated
the thai food{aspositive} is good
great selection of wine{aspositive} and seafood{aspositive}
acceptable prices{aspositive}
we were seated at the sushi bar{asneutral} in front of yasuda
as i made the title it's an affordable restaurant for great taste{aspositive}
definitely not worth the price{asnegative}
orsay is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional french food{aspositive} and french service{aspositive} as well
it's easy to get a table{aspositive} for a large group and you don't get hustled out
great food{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive}
salads{aspositive} are a delicious way to begin the meal{aspositive}
i ordered tamarind duck{aspositive} and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef{aspositive} and we were both delighted by the way the dishes{aspositive} evoked thai flavors{aspositive} in unexpected ways
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view{aspositive} the chart house has to offer
the prices{aspositive} are about $9 for an entree{aspositive} for dinner{asneutral} and even less for lunch{aspositive}
and you can't beat the prices{aspositive}
should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine{aspositive} definitely try it
i had the black cod with yuzu sauce{aspositive} which was wonderful
prices{asnegative} too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant
total hipster wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot{aspositive}
yes there might be a wait{asnegative} if you have no reservations{asneutral}
everything from the soft bread{asnegative} soggy salad{asnegative} and 50 minute wait{asnegative} time with an incredibly rude service{asnegative} to deliver below average food{asnegative}
the sicilian{aspositive} is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza{aspositive} is great
downstairs lounge{aspositive} is always a good attraction
the menu prices{asnegative} are a bit expensive for what you get in quality{asnegative} and portion size{asnegative}
the food{aspositive} was amazing and the service{aspositive} was prompt and helpful but not over bearing or rushed
food{asneutral} was delivered by a busboy{asnegative} not waiter{asnegative} we got no cheese{asnegative} offered for the pasta{asnegative} our water and wine glasses{asnegative} remained empty our entire meal{asneutral} when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine{asneutral}
the takeout{aspositive} is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
the food{asnegative} was not fresh the sauces{asnegative} were bland and very oily
could be pricey without a prix fixe meal{asnegative}
this is definitely an excellent date spot{aspositive} because of the ambiance{aspositive} and on the weekends the night scene{aspositive} is more than alive
one of us actually liked the expresso{aspositive} that's it
again the waitress{aspositive} was awesome
i loved everythig about it especially the shows{aspositive} and actors{aspositive}
the service{aspositive} was fast and friendly and the food{aspositive} was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce{aspositive} to add to your meals{asneutral}
the food{asneutral} was just ok i would never go back
zero ambiance{asnegative} to boot
scalina fedeli reminded me why service{aspositive} is so integral to fine dining{aspositive}
i recommend the thai popcorn{aspositive}
everything looks great the drinks{aspositive} the decor{aspositive} the food{aspositive} even the people
as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check{asneutral} a chef{asnegative} appeared to usher us out
the parathas{aspositive} and kebabs{aspositive} are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed
the tuna{aspositive} and wasabe potatoes{aspositive} are excellent
the only disappointment was the coat check girls{asnegative} who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non busy night for the coat check girls{asnegative}
my fiance took me to scopa last week for my birthday and i couldn't believe the food{aspositive}
ummm the beer{aspositive} was cold
we had great desserts{aspositive} including the best cannoli{aspositive} i've ever had and then they offered an after dinner drink{aspositive} on the house
good crowd good outdoor seating{aspositive} with a hip japanese vibe{aspositive}
even with the prix fixe pricing this restaurant is not worth it
we asked to be moved which took half an hour and then were seated in a high traffic area{asnegative} in the back even though the rest of the room{asneutral} was practically empty
good to find a restaurant where the owners{aspositive} have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off like in this case
however their popularity has yet to slow down and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance{aspositive} and delectable reputation
where tanks{asnegative} in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad looking marine life in their murky waters the tanks{aspositive} at ping's are clear as glass with healthy looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum{asneutral} lover's brunch{asneutral}
the halibut{asnegative} was too salty dessert{asneutral} was so so don't waste any of your calories and service{asnegative} was poor
the view{aspositive} is spectacular and the food{aspositive} is great
the place wasn't too hard to find but it was kind of packed as soon as my boyfriend and i got our food{asneutral} the line reached the door
good bagels{aspositive} and good cream cheese{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is wonderful tasty and filling and the service{aspositive} is professional and friendly
it is also extremely well priced{aspositive}
always great service{aspositive}
i am happy i did the food{aspositive} was awsome
we ordered the chicken casserole{asnegative} but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken{asnegative} all dark meat{asnegative} and on the bone
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine{asnegative} from the wind coming from the tracks
i went to df for valentines day dinner{asneutral}
i recommend the jelly fish{aspositive} drunken chicken{aspositive} and the soupy dumplings{aspositive} certainly the stir fry blue crab{aspositive}
i loved the shows{aspositive}
we could have made a meal{aspositive} of the yummy dumplings{aspositive} from the dumpling menu{aspositive}
the aesthetics{asnegative} of this place{asnegative} are like an airport lounge
then get ripped on free box wine{aspositive}
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food{aspositive}
if you don't mind pre sliced low quality fish{asnegative} unfriendly staff{asnegative} and a sushi chef{asnegative} that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
the food{asneutral} itself was just ok nothing spectacular but the service{asnegative} was awful
the pizza{aspositive} is yummy and i like the atmoshpere{aspositive}
as there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats{asnegative} except at taj mahal
also don't plan on asking for your favorite roll{asnegative} if it's not on the menu{asnegative} you can't have it
good food{aspositive}
those rolls were big but not good and sashimi{asnegative} wasn't fresh
the pesto pizza{aspositive} was excellent thin crust pizza{aspositive} with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese{aspositive} that i'd never heard of before
try the spicy shrimp appetizer{aspositive} again not the greatest value in the world but worth the price and the lamb vindaloo{aspositive} is great
however go for the ambience{aspositive} and consider the food{asnegative} just a companion for a trip across the world
food was good not great not worth the wait{asnegative} or another visit
i have had so many dinners{aspositive} here and it's always been perfect on a date with my husband with my mom with girlfriends and larger groups
when you want a piece of beef{aspositive} head on over
delicate spices{aspositive} onions{aspositive} eggs{aspositive} and a kick ass roti{aspositive}
incredible food{aspositive} at a very agreable price{aspositive} brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant
also if you don't want to sit at a certain table{aspositive} you don't have to
the menu{aspositive} has lots of options i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes{aspositive}
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling{aspositive}
the staff{asnegative} isn't the friendliest or most competent and i am stickler for service{asnegative} but everything else about this place makes up for it
my wife and i will usually only order one primi{aspositive} and one secondi{aspositive} and split them as they tend to offer large portions{aspositive}
i've overheard comments from him to his employees{asnegative} that should not have been delivered in the dining area{asneutral} and i've been sitting there while he lectured another customer
delicious crab cakes{aspositive} too
this was the worst dining experience{asnegative} i've ever had
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service{aspositive} and the great staff{aspositive} at la lanterna
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter{asnegative} may not understand you
the bruschetta{aspositive} and panini{aspositive} are so yummy
food{asneutral} was okay nothing great
every waitress{asneutral} and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair
always popular always full always a wait{asnegative}
it is run by the same sichuan chef{asneutral} who started the chain in chinatown
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety serving{asneutral} almost 40% of items bbq ed and a spicy tuna roll{asnegative} wrapped with not so fresh nori{asnegative} seems to be a rather limp performance
i can't wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio{aspositive}
best pastrami{aspositive} i ever had and great portion{aspositive} without being ridiculous
if you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food{asneutral} to spare or share kai may not be the best option
go here for the drinks{aspositive}
the first 2 courses{aspositive} were very good but the chocolate sampler{asnegative} was too rich for me and the dessert wine{asnegative} far too sweet
butter{asnegative} was melted white wine{asnegative} warm cheese{asnegative} oozing everywhere
we had a party in their private room{asneutral} and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning
it cannot be the ambience{asnegative} because the place{asnegative} is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle{asnegative}
we were disappointed with the pre fixe menu{asnegative} of only 2 choices per course{asneutral} other restaurants offer 3 choices and ended up ordering a la carte{asnegative}
authentic pakistani food{aspositive}
the staff{aspositive} has always been friendly without seeming grating and the chef{aspositive} has greeted us on a couple of occasions
the eggplant parmesan{aspositive} is also great and my friend who grew up in manhattan claims that no one serves{aspositive} a better baked ziti with meatsauce{aspositive}
quality ingredients{aspositive} preparation all around and a very fair price{aspositive} for nyc
service{aspositive} was very good prompt attentive and non intrusive
my entree{aspositive} of hot pot with seafood{asnegative} was full of imitation crabmeat{asnegative} with a couple pieces of shrimp{asnegative} and squid{asnegative} and was unnecessarily heated with a burner
we began with the cheese fondue{asneutral} the artisanal blend and added apples{asneutral} and kielbasa{asneutral} to dip
in such a crappy part of town to find a good value{aspositive} for lunch{aspositive} this place is great
its not curry{asneutral} in a slurry crap and regular run of the mill food{asneutral}
in fact while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu{asneutral} and i couldn't help telling them that the food{asnegative} was horrible
even though the restaurant was packed we were seated{aspositive} promptly and even asked for a table{aspositive} upstairs with no problems
if you want americanized chinese food{asneutral} with your usual watery generic white sauce{asnegative} this is your place
the bread{aspositive} is the soft paratha bread{aspositive} unlike the plain bread{asnegative} they use in calcutta and the stuffing{aspositive} is tandoori{aspositive} styled and very flavorful
service{aspositive} is friendly prices{aspositive} are good delivery time{asnegative} was a little slow but for the way this pizza{aspositive} tastes i'm willing to overlook it
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food{aspositive} for a good price{aspositive} and they cater the food{aspositive} to any food{asneutral} allergies or food{asnegative} you don't like
the service{aspositive} is excellent the decor{aspositive} is great and the food{aspositive} is delicious and comes in large portions{aspositive}
an excellent service{aspositive}
the food{asneutral} however is what one might expect
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice{aspositive} is the must
the pizza{aspositive} was really good
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting the additional menu items{asnegative} are only written in chinese
food{asneutral} is average and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchi's tastes better
the place{asnegative} is small and cramped but the food{aspositive} is fantastic
the food{aspositive} is tasty and portion sizes{aspositive} are appropriate
kosher dills{aspositive} are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich{aspositive} and they give you plenty of them
the entertainment{aspositive} was great they have shows{aspositive} that go on through out the dinner{asneutral}
the food{aspositive} is so cheap and the waiters{aspositive} are nice
the food{aspositive} there is so good that even to order out the wait{asnegative} is incredible
the bartender{asnegative} on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that i will never go back
their sushi{aspositive} kamikaze{aspositive} and other rolls{aspositive} are fresh and well presented
for authentic thai food{aspositive} look no further than toons
the highlight of the night was the mayonaisse{asnegative} for my side of fries{asnegative} i received from one of the food runners{asneutral} which is not good considering the bill{asnegative} was nearly $100
i choose to go with one of the special{aspositive} the braised lamb shank in red wine{aspositive} which was excellent
if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines{asneutral} please check their wine list{aspositive}
the only concern i have is with the slighly all business waitstaff{asnegative} who order and throw the food{asneutral} down rushing you out
have the iced tea{aspositive}
small servings{asnegative} for main entree{asnegative} i had salmon{asnegative} wasnt impressed girlfriend had chicken{aspositive} it was good
you can actually get 2 salads{asnegative} worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce{asneutral}
the ambience{aspositive} is very romantic and definitely a good place{aspositive} to bring a date
it is far more popular as a bar{aspositive} than as a restaurant with only a few tables{asnegative} and the waiter{asneutral} being the bartender{asneutral} but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is very good for it's price{aspositive} better than most fried dumplings{asnegative} i've had
there are much better places in ny with better prices{asnegative}
obv caviar{aspositive} is top of the line but the rest of the menu{aspositive} is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes{asnegative} average at best and too expensive
still try it once since if you end up loving the food{asneutral} it could be one of your best dining experiences{aspositive}
i've waited over one hour for food{asneutral}
other guests enjoyed pizza{aspositive} santa fe chopped salad{aspositive} and fish and chips{aspositive}
the ambience{aspositive} is very calm and quiet
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service{asnegative} which was boarderline rude
not only does make the best pizza{aspositive} in ny maybe anywhere
the spicy tuna roll{aspositive} is huge and probably the best that i've had at this price range{aspositive}
price{asnegative} and quality{asnegative} of fish{asnegative} alone will keep us from making a return visit
our waiter{aspositive} and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine
the place{aspositive} is a bistro which means simple dishes{aspositive} and wine{aspositive} served{aspositive} efficiently in a bustling atmosphere{aspositive}
this is one of the best comfort food{aspositive} places in the city
overall the ingredients{aspositive} and technique{aspositive} are there and i am encouraged enough to return at lunch{asneutral} or dinner{asneutral} to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves
i had a huge pastrami sandwich{aspositive} on a roll
though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table{asnegative} with what seems like barely enough room{asnegative} no matter what the size of your party the warm atomosphere{aspositive} is worth the cramped quarters you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot{asnegative} you're in
the fish{asnegative} was not fresh and the rice{asnegative} tasted old and stale
considering their price{asnegative} of $6 25 for lunch special{asnegative} the dish{asnegative} was ridiculously small
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food{aspositive} all fast foods in my opinion
besides when you have bad service{asnegative} that's less money{asnegative} you have to tip{asnegative}
the wine list{aspositive} is also really nice
service{aspositive} was devine oysters{aspositive} where a sensual as they come and the price{aspositive} can't be beat
compared to ess a tal offers a less doughy bagel{asnegative}
ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food{aspositive}
the service{aspositive} was attentive yet discreet
for those prices{asnegative} and the dressed up atmosphere{asnegative} you expect more and should get more
they offer the same menu{asneutral} but have creative drinks{aspositive} that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names but they do cost you
we went to eat at the jekyll and hyde restaurant on friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere{aspositive} and good food{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions{aspositive}
unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place{asnegative} and are not in a rush this place{asnegative} is a bad idea
you have to increase the service{asnegative} a lot
ambiance{asnegative} is barely romantic but management{aspositive} tries
i must warn the reader that the portions{asnegative} sizes are very small especially the appetizers{asnegative} so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef{aspositive} special tasting menu{aspositive} prepare to order and pay for an appetizer{asnegative} 1 dish{asnegative} for each person because the portions{asnegative} are not for sharing a main entree{asneutral} and the cold udon{asneutral} at the end of the meal
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food{asnegative} was late because they were out of rice{asneutral}
after we got our sashimi{asneutral} order i could not believe how small the portions{asnegative} were
after the main course{asneutral} came we didn't see our waiter{asnegative} for at least 40 minutes
nothing better than buying a snapple{aspositive} for $3 25 too
when family came in he gave them apps{asneutral} to test their palets and then ordered for them
service{aspositive} is extraordinary yet not overbearing and the decor{aspositive} brings a taste of trendy soho into queens
the dosas{asnegative} are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally i'd drink popcorn topping{asneutral} before i'd eat another one of these
the service{aspositive} was excellent and the food{aspositive} was delicious
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene{asnegative} and annoying customers{asnegative} i'd go out in manhattan
after a seafood{asneutral} craving i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info
right off the major deegan you get ladies{aspositive} from all over the city
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait{asnegative} may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating
the food was very good but not very thai
thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving{aspositive} you but the food{asnegative} doesn't quite match up
the fillings{asneutral} may be unconventional but the dosa batter{aspositive} is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty
this is the perfect spot{aspositive} for meeting friends having lunch{aspositive} dinner{aspositive} pre theatre or after theatre drinks{aspositive}
the mussaman curry{asnegative} that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu{asnegative} that i ordered in it they graciously provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato{asnegative}
had a late night dinner{asneutral} on a saturday night
a restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food{aspositive} with great service{aspositive} in a pleasant atmosphere{aspositive}
their sake martini{aspositive} is wonderful
well this place{asnegative} is so ghetto its not even funny
once they ran out of gnochi{asneutral} and made it for me from scratch
we would like to thank marcelo and grace for a wonderful dining{aspositive} experience
found service{aspositive} above average but that could be because we were 13 of us
bagels{asneutral} are ok but be sure not to make any special requests
fine dining restaurant quality{aspositive}
overall a disappointing experience for that price{asnegative} category
i've had the lunch buffet{asneutral} at chennai a couple of times when i have been in the neighborhood
the food{aspositive} was exceptional
a thai restaurant out of rice{asneutral} during dinner{asneutral}
the portions{asnegative} are small but being that the food{aspositive} was so good makes up for that
and i have eaten my share which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve{aspositive}
sure the setting{aspositive} is nice
the service{aspositive} is friendly if not the most prompt in the world the food{aspositive} is great and the prices while not cheap won't put your wallet out of commission
had 1 appetizer{asneutral} 2 entrees{asneutral} and 2 cokes{asneutral} and the bill{asneutral} was ~$55 00 not including tip
best drumsticks over rice{aspositive} and sour spicy soup{aspositive} in town
slightly above average wines{asnegative} start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+
their whitefish salad{aspositive} is excellent all whitefish{aspositive} with a little mayo{aspositive}
and it all comes at a very reasonable price{aspositive} congee{asneutral} noodles{asneutral} and rice dishes{asneutral} are no more than $3 6 each
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce{asnegative} and boxed pasta{asnegative} and the chicken with portobello mushrooms{asnegative} consisted of dry inedible chicken{asnegative} with terrible sauce{asnegative}
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal{aspositive}
the waitresses{aspositive} are nice also you can just get counter service{aspositive} sit
the only friendly staff member{aspositive} was the guy{aspositive} at the bar{asneutral}
you can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience but for superb food{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive} la villa can't be beat
won't or can't is not in the service{aspositive} directory
i cannot imagine a friendlier staff{aspositive} working in a restaurant
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs{aspositive} if you are looking to be a little cozy
the red curry{asnegative} is weak and tasteless the pad thai{asnegative} is stuck together and lumpy the rice{asnegative} is often overcooked and the seafood{asnegative} is pretty sketchy
the wine list{aspositive} is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced{aspositive} meal{aspositive}
saul{asneutral} is pretty good but definitely not great
i would recommend roxy's for that but not for their food{asnegative}
we always get a sampling of appetizers{asneutral} and share
overall i was impressed and will return it's a great qpr quality{aspositive} to price{aspositive} ratio
it is nearly impossible to get a table{asnegative} so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner{aspositive} do not pass it up
their pad penang{aspositive} is delicious and everything else is fantastic
the puke green walls{asnegative} leave a lot to be desired but the food{aspositive} is very good
the flavors{aspositive} are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive nothing flashy
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people{asnegative} who work there are evil and incompetent
the hanger steak{asnegative} was like rubber and the tuna{asnegative} was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
our son loves pizza{aspositive} and we have a certified neapolitan pizzaria in our home city seattle we liked this nearly as much and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant
big and soft as well as good lunch food{aspositive}
no food{asneutral} snobs allowed this place is for people who appreciate good food{aspositive}
i liked the food{aspositive} at this quasi thai{aspositive} restaurant
by far the best salad{aspositive} i have had in a fast food{asneutral} restaurant
as for the bar{asnegative} this is another bad idea
their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a 'special' bagel{asneutral} experience
unlike hh up the block this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels{aspositive} this town is known for
the barebecued salmon{aspositive} is elegantly spiced and not at all dry
same owner{asneutral} as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st marks and 1st ave
what generous portions{aspositive}
the workers{asneutral} there also absolutely load the bagel{asneutral} with cream cheese{asneutral} gets a little messy
the wine{aspositive} the service{aspositive} was very good too
so the menu{asneutral} is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious
the highly spiced chai tea{aspositive} was great too
i have been there many times and food{aspositive} is good and consistent
seriously this is the best all you can eat in town as everyone says the spicy tuna hand rolls{aspositive} are the best have 4 of these and you've broken even
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance{aspositive} and probably has the best decor{aspositive} of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city the food{asnegative} was not what i had hoped for
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere{aspositive} that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine
the meat dishes{asneutral} were only so so
his wife tanya the hostess{aspositive} completes the comforting atmosphere{aspositive} by being delightfully warm and gracious
the menu{aspositive} consisted of standard brassiere food{aspositive} better then places like balthazar etc
i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village and while i do believe their food{asnegative} has slightly slipped in quality{asnegative} i have been hesitant to be disloyal
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere{aspositive} delightfully free of the bts
we even had a visit from the manager{aspositive} who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
the staff{aspositive} there is very attentive and down to earth
you don't go to mizu for excellent service{asnegative} you go for the large amounts of food{aspositive} the amiable atmosphere{aspositive} and the hole in the wall feeling of the place
the service{asnegative} is always bad though don't expect much of anything from your server{asnegative} and i would not recommend bringing a date here either
monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix{aspositive} this includes a three course meal{aspositive} plus *three* glasses of wine{aspositive} paired with each course{asneutral}
it took them 15 minutes to put water{asneutral} in our glasses
the service{aspositive} is descent even when this small place{asnegative} is packed
this is the best sushi{aspositive} in new york city hands down
i have eaten a lot of pizza{asneutral} here
great value for the quality ingredients{aspositive}
the thali{asnegative} was small thoroughly unremarkable and $14 95
the sushi{aspositive} is also great
from the complimentary chef app{aspositive} of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce{aspositive} to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree{aspositive} to a dessert{asneutral} that i can't remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet{aspositive} we were drinking the whole evening was amazing
truly the mark of an attentive waiter{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake{aspositive} and we had several other nice pastries{aspositive}
the staff{aspositive} is very kind and well trained they're fast they are always prompt to jump behind the bar{asneutral} and fix drinks{asneutral} they know details of every item in the menu{asneutral} and make excelent recomendations
the makhani{asneutral} was ok the korma{asnegative} was bland
the food{aspositive} is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring
though the service could be better possibly due to more than one very large group in the house it is very cordial and warm as is the general clientele
the decor{aspositive} in this place is very diner ish and the kind of place{aspositive} you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse
this is a cute place{aspositive} and could be good but they need to get their act together
the lox{aspositive} is always fresh too
service{aspositive} was very friendly
so all i'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food{aspositive} restaurant i've ever been to
food{asneutral} was ok fish{aspositive} was cooked well
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food{aspositive}
the duck confit{aspositive} is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs{aspositive} was out of this world
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff{asnegative} because despite the current one this is a great place
the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely
the staff{aspositive} offers impeccable service{aspositive}
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun dessert{aspositive} recommended by the waiter{aspositive}
this place doesn't compare with mamoun's in terms of price{asnegative} freshness{asnegative} value{asnegative} and consisent quality{asnegative} but that's just my opinion
the place{aspositive} is sleek modern and playfull and i will return again frequently
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years emilio the godfather has continued to serve food{aspositive} and wine{aspositive} for the gods at mortal prices{aspositive}
the brioche and lollies{aspositive} as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal{aspositive}
after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties multiples of 2 and higher seated for 40 minutes the three of us were squished into a small 2 person table{asnegative}
and the bill{asnegative} was outragous
the service was attentive yet unimposing the food{aspositive} was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list{aspositive} is extensive and well priced{aspositive}
kind attentive wait staff{aspositive}
salads{aspositive} were fantastic
the owners{aspositive} and employees{aspositive} are friendly and their pizza{aspositive} is fantastic
the food{aspositive} is yummy especially their cooked to perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce{aspositive} and their shoestring crispy fries{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is authentic italian delicious
skip dessert{asnegative}
i complete the total bagel{aspositive} experience by having it lightly toasted
it was like the servers{asnegative} forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool
the service{aspositive} is good and ambience{aspositive} is good for a date or group outing
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple{asneutral} from costco and sell it right outside for only $2 50
it's all about the food{aspositive}
fast service{aspositive}
the staff{aspositive} is excellent specjal that girl behind the bar{asneutral} european chic
stick with the chicken{aspositive} beef{aspositive} and lamb dishes{aspositive}
the service{asnegative} was bad the food{asnegative} took to forever to come we sat on the upper level
we a menu that rearely changes e xcept for one or two specials{asneutral} the quality{aspositive} and care{aspositive} they put in thier food{aspositive} in evident
the decor is nice but more casual than fine dining
this restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced{aspositive}
bottom line b+ for the food{aspositive} f for the service{asnegative}
the only thing the waiters{aspositive} don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
stick to dimsum{aspositive} not super overpriced noodles{asneutral}
the service{aspositive} is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view{aspositive}
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff{asnegative} acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
delicious simple food{aspositive} in nice outdoor atmosphere{aspositive}
the food is good but very expensive for the casualness of it
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices{asnegative}
i've been to naples 45 for dinner{asneutral} twice
the hot and sour soup{asnegative} was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper{asnegative} and nothing else
try sushimi cucumber roll{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is delicious
their wines by the glass{aspositive} are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine{asneutral} for under $30
this place{aspositive} has the the correct ambience{aspositive} and an excellent staff{aspositive} to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good they use the same amount of salt{asnegative} but without sweetness to balance out
believe us we've been eating sushi{asneutral} for over 15 yrs
the atmosphere{aspositive} is much better than sripraphai more modern and sleek
the food{aspositive} is outstanding and the service{aspositive} is quick friendly and very professional
the bagels{aspositive} always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size
i had a late dinner{asneutral} at lucky stike a great name for a joint if ever i saw one
service{aspositive} is fast and friendly
from an english speaking staff{asneutral}
and they have these home made potato chips{aspositive} at the bar{asneutral} that are the most delicious things in the world
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions{aspositive} and left completely full
i went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table{asnegative}
we all ate pasta entre'es{aspositive} which were great
the steak{aspositive} was excellent and one of the best i have had i tasted the butter{asnegative} intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor{asneutral} of the meat{aspositive}
the food{asnegative} was boring and expensive
the ambience{aspositive} is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch{aspositive} here would probably be best
terrific menu{aspositive} full of unique rolls{aspositive} and special dishes{aspositive}
the service{asnegative} is ok but could be better
we love the food{aspositive} drinks{aspositive} and atmosphere{aspositive}
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service{asnegative} experience at a restaurant ever
went on a 3 day oyster{asneutral} binge with fish{asneutral} bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place{aspositive} it o trip ended because it was so great
took my mom for mother's day and the maitre d'{asnegative} was pretty rude
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar{asneutral} chef{asneutral} yoshi and ordered everything ala carte{asneutral}
the vibe{aspositive} is very relaxed and cozy service{aspositive} was great and the food{aspositive} was excellent
if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table{aspositive}
if you are looking for a good quality{aspositive} cheap eats this is the place
the service{aspositive} was friendly and the atmosphere{aspositive} was casual
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels{asneutral} and they would still be better than any else
i recommend their pad see ew{aspositive} pork chops{aspositive} or tofu plates{aspositive}
never in my life did i think that i could be satisfied both in taste{aspositive} and in quantity{aspositive} for $3 00 in nyc
this is the best secret place in midtown' i heard that from the bartender{asneutral} after having brilliant food{aspositive} try steak with portobello mushrooms{aspositive} and drinks{aspositive} on the bar{asneutral} last tuesday
the service{aspositive} was excellent friendly and attentive
the main course{aspositive} had an average portion{asneutral} and was decent overall
20 minutes for our reservation{asnegative} but it gave us time to have a few cocktails{aspositive} and enjoy our surroundings{aspositive} and each other
waitstaff{aspositive} is great very attentive
the dinner menu{aspositive} is diverse and top notch as well
it is what modern cuisine{aspositive} is all about
i don't like indian food{aspositive} too much and this was delicious however you want to factor that into the equation
at taj vegetarians can rejoice all the dishes{aspositive} are manna from heaven
forget the rush and the wait and the noise which isn't actually that bad i mean please who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic
i won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill{asnegative}
we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagels{asneutral} to eat hot and then to freeze they told me that if i call in the order they'd bring it out to the car so i wouldn't have to look for parking
jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot{aspositive} in the bronx
and i would have to agree with the masses in terms of service{asnegative} delivery{asnegative} is their achilles' heel
the $300 bill{asnegative} was a bit steep but the experience was great
nice ambiance{aspositive} nice little bar{aspositive} good bartender{aspositive} francois and good service{aspositive}
the calamari{aspositive} comes with an incredible sauce{aspositive} and the duck noodles{aspositive} are yummy as well
i would definitely go back if only for some of those exotic martinis{aspositive} on the blackboard
simple comfort food{aspositive} and what hot and lage portions{aspositive}
stay away from the two specialty rolls{asnegative} on the menu{asneutral} though too much avocado{asnegative} and rice{asnegative} will fill you up right quick
we didn't get drink refills{asnegative} and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert{asneutral}
the bagels{aspositive} are also reasonably priced{aspositive} for nyc
if you can handle that it's a great place for a business dinner{aspositive} fun with friends or simply a table{aspositive} for 2
decor{asnegative} leaves something to be desired
also specify if you like your food{asneutral} spicy its rather bland if you don't
our waiter{aspositive} was fine the place{aspositive} looks nice in that not trying too hard way but at those prices{asnegative} a little more should be expected of your food{asnegative}
coming from boston this place is like emma's pizza in kendall square in cambridge although they have more funky toppings{aspositive}
when my husband and go there we spend $60 00 have lobster tails{aspositive} ummmmm need i say more i can't say any more it a place{aspositive} you'll never forget if you never go you'll miss a meal{aspositive} of your life time
in an effort to increase turnover the restaurant offers no desserts{asnegative} beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse{aspositive}
i've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when i'm craving for pho{aspositive} lemon grass chicken{aspositive} or beef cube on rice{aspositive} this is the place to go
oh yes and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars there are plenty of portraits{aspositive} of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls some of which i would love to know where they obtained
the food{aspositive} is spectacular from the appitizers{aspositive} to the main course{aspositive} and then of course the desserts{aspositive} wow you'll need no more
my fish{aspositive} was delicious in an incredible curry sauce{aspositive}
if you are in search of the most authentic nyc deli{aspositive} experience look no further than the famous and historic katz's deli down on the lower east side
even upon delivery their juicy pork buns{aspositive} are quite good
average to good thai food{aspositive} but terrible delivery{asnegative}
the space{aspositive} is nice but when we order our drink{asnegative} we were in for a surprise
the entire place{asnegative} and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt
joe's pizza used to have the best slice{aspositive} until this pizzeria opened up
and they provided a delicious dessert{aspositive} on the house
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine so if you want to make a reservation{asnegative} you are limited
the food{aspositive} is amazing rich pastas{aspositive} and fresh doughy pizza{aspositive}
food{aspositive} was very good but not what i would consider out of this world
i had lobster bisque{aspositive} it has 2 oz of maine lobster{aspositive} in it
try the pad thai{aspositive} it's fabulous and their prices{aspositive} are so cheap
food{aspositive} is great and inexpensive
the price{aspositive} very reasonable
dessert{aspositive} can't be missed so save room
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order but once the food{aspositive} is ordered you are in for a treat
ingredients{aspositive} are organic which is a real plus for me
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food{asnegative}
i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine{aspositive} at reasonable prices{aspositive}
the staff{aspositive} was very attentive the ambience{aspositive} lovely and the food{aspositive} superb
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants{aspositive} makes the food{aspositive} fine cuisine{aspositive} even with no idea how to use them
the pizza{aspositive} and wine{aspositive} were excellent the service{aspositive} too but what really made this place was the backyard dining area{aspositive}
the waiters{aspositive} are sweet the food{aspositive} is tasty and the bill{aspositive} is never too large
the service{aspositive} was superb they treat you like family
we all had the tasting menu{aspositive} and unlike some of the other reviews i felt there was more than enough food{aspositive}
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table{aspositive} but standing up wasn't too bad
the menu{asnegative} may be small but everything on it is delicious
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice{asnegative} result we had large chunks of burnt rice{asnegative} in our serving bowl
for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato with espresso which were tasty but i thought a bit overpriced
warm comfortable surroundings{aspositive} nice appointments witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms{asneutral}
we ran a little late for the reservation{asneutral} but it wasn't a problem to get our table{aspositive} immediately
we arrived on time for our reservation{aspositive} and seated promptly the
i would definitely go back for a very special occasion but not for regular fine dining{asneutral}
the well mannered pleasant staff{aspositive} that tony has in his employ
the flavors{aspositive} robust and subtle
all i can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters{aspositive} you'll find in the city though the quality{aspositive} is some of the best
i would never wait for a table{asneutral} to eat it just is not that great
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake{aspositive} both were delicious
the counter service{asnegative} is bad
service{aspositive} here was great food{aspositive} was fantastic
this is such a lovely peaceful place{aspositive} to eat outside
the sauce{aspositive} is delicious and the crust{aspositive} is perfect
since my first dinner{asneutral} i have had the chance to have brunch{asneutral} at orsay 3x
you will pay a lot for the decore{asnegative} but the food{asneutral} is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny
they have some great entrees{aspositive} here as well
the service{asneutral} is not consistently excellent just decent
the food{aspositive} served{asneutral} in small tasting portions{aspositive} as an option is very good with each dish{aspositive} being better than the next
they do cater{aspositive} to american palates but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige
i had the mango chicken{aspositive} and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation{aspositive} was beatiful
i care more about the food{asneutral} and ambience{asneutral}
oh but wait we were out of drinks{asnegative} which were also delightfully overpriced
the service{aspositive} is fantastic
the garlic mashed potatoes{aspositive} are hands down the best in the city
food{asneutral} and service{asneutral} was okay
the lamb meat{asnegative} was under cooked and extrmely chewy
the best pad thai{aspositive} i've ever had
over time the food quality{asnegative} has decreased substantially it is a lot less crowded than it used to and the service{asnegative} must definitely be part of the reason
great pizza{aspositive} and fantastic service{aspositive}
we were seated outside{asneutral} and the waiter{asnegative} spilled red wine{asneutral} and hot tea{asneutral} on myself and my date
i would just ask for no oil{asnegative} next time
while this is a pretty place{aspositive} in that overly cute french way the food{asnegative} was insultingly horrible
i went there for lunch{asneutral} and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read
the wine list{asnegative} isn't great and the desserts{asnegative} are shipped in from bruno's down the street which is not as good as it used to be
i ordered a lassi{asneutral} and asked 4 times for it but never got it
their coffee{aspositive} is quite good too
great wine list{aspositive} italian good food{aspositive} service was initially fine
despite the fact that the space{aspositive} is large they've overcrowded the floor with tables{asnegative}
as far as the service goes the waitresses were not particularly friendly but they got the job done
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place{asnegative} but also become hostile
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish{asneutral} ive requested
normally that would be improper however they were all delicious and my host{asneutral} did not complain
taxan{aspositive} delicious
unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches{asnegative} you want only come as a triple decker here you can get what you want in a reasonably sized portion{aspositive} and price{aspositive}
southern indian cuisine{asneutral} is still there too
restaurant snobs need not bother this is a small neighborhood kind of place{aspositive}
they couldn't even make a salad{asnegative} that was appealing
for two people with tip{asneutral} was less than $25 bucks
killer sushi{aspositive}
of course the reason its so packed is because the food{aspositive} is so delicious
staffs{asnegative} are not that friendly but the taste{aspositive} covers all
the jukebox{aspositive} plays everything from italian opera to the strokes
plus they made a perfect martini{aspositive}
i am not sure if i would call the food{asneutral} here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch
i've eaten thai many times and am very familiar with the cuisine{asneutral}
the waiter{aspositive} was attentive
their margarita{aspositive} is best i've had since i've returned from naples
the tastes{aspositive} makes your mouth water for more
their sake list{aspositive} was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which wasn't listed but made for us upon request
the tables{asnegative} are crammed way too close the menu{asneutral} is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list{asnegative} is simply overpriced
the food{asnegative} was actually aweful
they are served{asneutral} with a free appetizer{aspositive} and the portions{aspositive} are perfect for lunch{asneutral}
there is actually space{aspositive} to breathe and the decor{aspositive} sets the tone for an intimate dinner{asneutral}
we went around 9 30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service{aspositive} was great
my husband and i both ordered the steak{asneutral} medium
furthermore the rice{asnegative} had no seasoning{asnegative} so the sushi{asnegative} was bland and disgusting
this place has realy fresh sushi{aspositive} and a nice large menu{aspositive} of japanese classic cuisine{aspositive}
the sushi{asneutral} is average and the prices{asneutral} are anything but
my wife and i also enjoyed the spinach{aspositive} the shanghai low mein{aspositive} and other attractions
owner{asneutral} must have coem on this website to give himself credit
turned out there was full service{aspositive} upstairs and sat down
several of the dim sum orders{asneutral} had about 6 8 pieces
if you have a dumpling{aspositive} fetish i suggest you try some here
three page wine menu{aspositive} one page entree{aspositive} and horedevous{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is consistently wonderful i've been coming here for years and the owner{aspositive} has always been accomodating and friendly
the waiters{asnegative} and owners{asnegative} were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected
and the food{aspositive} was fantastic
if you're looking for a place to sit down have a drink{asneutral} and conversations with friends go to sweet n tart and order yourself a hong kong styled milk{aspositive} and tea with tapioca pearls hot{aspositive}
aside from the sea urchin{asneutral} the chef{asneutral} recommended an assortment of fish{asneutral} including fatty yellow tail{asneutral} boton shrimp{asneutral} blue fin torro fatty tuna{asneutral} sea eel{asneutral} etc
they're also friendlier here especially the owner{aspositive} kenny
while the room{asnegative} is not particularly comfortable once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate{aspositive}
i've lived in nyc all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs{asnegative} in one place except in a really bad dream
winnie and her staff{aspositive} are the best crew{aspositive} you can find serving{aspositive} you
the ambiance{aspositive} is minimal the food{asnegative} is not phenomenal but some dishes{aspositive} are quite good such as the eggplant parmesan{aspositive} veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca{aspositive}
my host{asneutral} asked for appetizers{asneutral} for the group and the waiter{asneutral} gave us not only what we ordered but some other items that were not ordered
you can even get packages of the chutneys{aspositive} to stock your fridge
the bar{aspositive} has various selections and the mixed drink special{aspositive} is a catcher 2 for 1's
if it isn't for the food{aspositive} a+++ it must be the service{aspositive} or the ambience{aspositive}
during the course of the past 3 months the chef{asnegative} and staff{asnegative} changed and it was not for the better
i like the ambience{aspositive} it's very dark and original
overall not worth the money{asnegative}
this place is not worth the prices{asnegative}
we left after one drink{asneutral}
pick a bagel has the best bagels{aspositive} in the city
you are paying for the atmosphere which is nice but can be had in numerous places in bay ridge
yes you have to wait{asnegative} to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area{asnegative} and the seat{asnegative} at the bar{asneutral} was all taken
the last two times i ordered from here my food{asnegative} was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice{asnegative} took away from the flavor{asnegative} of the dish{asnegative}
the fried dumplings{aspositive} are great
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs{aspositive} in the city
ive been here so many times the waiters{asneutral} know my name
the decor is very simple but comfortable
we figured we never had argentinian pizza{asneutral} before so we grabbed our lunch{asneutral} there sharing a large pelligrino{aspositive} a pizza{aspositive} of two of their specials one was goat cheese{aspositive} the other blue cheese{aspositive} and both were excellent
the kamasutra{aspositive} and 'bombay cosmopolitan{aspositive} are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time
this is the perfect date spot{aspositive} for williamsburg couples
the dim sum{asneutral} here is only so so
$6 and there is much tasty food{aspositive} all of it fresh and continually refilled
just straight up cheap good food{aspositive}
seating{asneutral} is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine if you can call $70 00 inexpensive the cost{asnegative} is through the roof for better than average fare
service{asnegative} was slow but the people{aspositive} were friendly
the steak{asnegative} was very fatty and the sauce{asnegative} was overpowering and not very tasty
the staff{aspositive} makes you feel at home the food{aspositive} is great and the atmosphere{aspositive} is wonderful
the food is alright some stuff is good some is not like the steak dish{asnegative} which tends to be dry
they have a very diverse menu{aspositive} so its something for everybody
the staff{asnegative} was too busy ordering sushi{asneutral} for dinner{asneutral} and then laying it out to eat on the bar{asneutral} to even bring me my check{asneutral}
as a long time patron of mamoun's i always figured that i had found the best late night food spot{aspositive} in the city
the bagel{asneutral} was huge
get the tuna{aspositive} of gari
i like the somosas{aspositive} chai{aspositive} and the chole{aspositive} but the dhosas{asnegative} and dhal{asnegative} were kinda dissapointing
edible but really a ripoff at those prices{asnegative} given whats in the area
the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom{asnegative} needs to be cleaned more often
the service{aspositive} was the only thing good about this restaurant
service{aspositive} friendly and attentive
service was very prompt but slightly rushed
great food{aspositive} great decor{aspositive} great service{aspositive}
and atlhough tables{asneutral} opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space{asneutral} they left us awkardly seated
the palak paneer{asneutral} was standard and i was not a fan of the malai kofta{asneutral}
i've dined at alain ducasse's restaurant in monte carlo for half the price{aspositive} for the same excellent dining{aspositive} experience
yeah sometimes the service{asnegative} can be slow
there was no ambiance{asnegative}
save your money and don't waste your calories go to margharita's on washington street instead they have amazing food{aspositive} and the best service{aspositive}
the service{aspositive} was attentive without being overbearing and each dish{aspositive} we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls{aspositive} to the cod with pineapple tempura{aspositive}
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle{asneutral} the waitress{asnegative} would have simply multiplied the glass price{asnegative} x4 which makes no sense whatsoever
they sell special sushi{aspositive} everything have a topping{aspositive} sauce{aspositive} and etc
do not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste{asnegative}
the place{asnegative} is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service{aspositive} is excellent and it's great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion
the service{aspositive} was excellent and the food{aspositive} was delicious
service{aspositive} was also very good
i took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing really good meal{aspositive}
i would not have been so disappointed with the portions{asnegative} if the qualities{asnegative} were good enough to make up for it but they were not
i'm happy to have nosh in the neighborhood and the food{aspositive} is very comforting
good atmosphere{aspositive} combination of all the hottest music{aspositive} dress cod{asnegative}e is relatively strict except on fridays
love the food{aspositive}
i would highly recommend nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner{aspositive} in a heart warming surrounding{aspositive} filled with candles{aspositive} and family pictures{aspositive}
all the desserts{aspositive} the group tried got favorable reviews
there's something smooth about sipping sake{aspositive} upper east side style
it's a nice place{aspositive} to relax and have conversation
best reuben sandwich{aspositive} ever
lucky strike is a great casual place{aspositive} to just grab a bite to eat
wonderful strawberry daiquiries{aspositive} as well
going to volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner{asneutral} assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook
the sushi{asnegative} has been from average to below average the wait service{asnegative} has always been sub par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating if you sit in the area{asnegative} beyond the kitchen the acousitcs are horrid everything echoes is extremely loud
frites{aspositive} were delicious if a bit on the thick side
here you get the zen feel{aspositive} without feeling rigid
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink{asneutral} at a local bar{asneutral} first though because of the wait time{asnegative}
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork{aspositive}
i keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table{asneutral} i can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup{asneutral} people
overall the best bagel{aspositive} in town
light refreshing summer rolls{aspositive} not fried remind me of vietnamese places in paris
the sushi{aspositive} seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
but the service{asnegative} was a bit slow
spreads{aspositive} and toppings{aspositive} are great though a bit pricey
when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli i knew there was going to be good pizza{aspositive}
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates{asneutral}
indoor{aspositive} was very cozy and cute
we had a 3 hour brunch{aspositive} they definitely do not rush you and they kept the unlimited mimosas{aspositive} flowing the whole time
and their prices{asnegative} are very high they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices{asnegative} for such terrible food{asnegative} and service{asnegative}
the service{aspositive} was excellent the food{aspositive} was excellent but the entire experience was very cool
the service{aspositive} is good and the resturant is clean
great spot{aspositive} whether looking for a couple of drinks{aspositive} or quiet dinner{aspositive}
just stick with the small dishes{asnegative}
the cafe{aspositive} itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs{aspositive} and tables{aspositive} but the service{asnegative} could have been better
i've rarely had a problem with slow staff{aspositive} in the 10 years i've been going
food{aspositive} is excellent
although we were looking for regular lettuce{asneutral} and some walnuts{asneutral} the salads{aspositive} we got were great
excellent lunch buffet{aspositive} for only $6 95
if you're not familiar with the cuisine{asnegative} you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards
both are very reasonably priced{aspositive} around $8 for dinner{aspositive} and $5 for lunch{aspositive} and are delicious and filling
ambience{aspositive} is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation
the portion sizes{aspositive} here are huge and the sushi{aspositive} is good
my boyfriend ate tuna{aspositive} and it was cooked perfectly
this wasn't the expected menu{asneutral} comprised only of pad thai{asneutral} and tom yum soup{asneutral} but i thought that was what made the place so special
good food{aspositive} at the restaurant a bit expensive but great if you want to impress your date
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar{aspositive} and fantastic service{aspositive}
you can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown
i have eaten there 3 4 times and the food{aspositive} was always good
i wasn't thrilled to have to wait{asnegative} on line for thirty minutes but i guess that's the price you pay for a popular place
great eats{aspositive} good times
grilled whole fish{aspositive} wonderful great spicing
for years i thought tuscan cuisine was the best but salvatore converted me to the hearty neapolitan fare{aspositive} on my first visit
plus when our entrees{asnegative} were held up in the kitchen on a busy saturday night the owner{aspositive} sent over complimentary summer rolls{aspositive} to hold us over
the service{aspositive} was great as well
try the lobster teriyaki{aspositive} and the rose special roll{aspositive}
another plus is most of the entrees{aspositive} are approx
the food{aspositive} was delicious the atmosphere{aspositive} was relaxed and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place{asnegative} was packed
i found the food{aspositive} service{aspositive} and value{aspositive} exceptional everytime i have been there
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods{asnegative}
the food{aspositive} is definitely good but i left a bit disappointed
i am a 100 lb girl had a glass of wine{asneutral} and a glass of beer{asneutral} prior to the dinner{asneutral} and i was still hungry after my visit to this place
the drinks{aspositive} are a saving grace but service staff{asnegative} please get over yourselves
there is a downside if you're ordering in the delivery guys{asnegative} have major attitude
the all italian staff{aspositive} is warm and engaging from the start
the prices{aspositive} are exceptionally reasonable for food{aspositive} of this caliber
if you go here your focus should be the tamarind margaritas{aspositive}
the filet mignon dish{aspositive} was superb
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food{aspositive} and ease of getting a table{aspositive}
this place{aspositive} is the most japanese it can ever get
the food{aspositive} is good i can't lie
great food{aspositive} lt's of it more then one person can eat
i didn't expect to like nosh as much as i did but the pastrami on challah sandwich{aspositive} i had was otherworldly the soups{aspositive} are like mom's and the knishes{aspositive} give yonah schimmel's a run for its money
the atmosphere{asneutral} is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo
cozy romantic atomosphere{aspositive} with only around 15 tables{aspositive} at most
this place is worth going even if only for their beer{aspositive}
i really like both the scallops{aspositive} and the mahi mahi on saffron risotto{aspositive} yum
the ambience{aspositive} was so fun and the prices{aspositive} were great on top of the fact that the food{aspositive} was really tasty
do not get the go go hamburgers{asnegative} no matter what the reviews say
the sandwhiches{aspositive} are out of this world
if you live in upper manhattan siam square is the place for thia food{aspositive}
decor{aspositive} is charming
the food{aspositive} was very well prepared
really tasty spring rolls{aspositive} and noodles{aspositive} for a good price{aspositive} though
good because hey it's more food{aspositive} but bad because dim sum{asnegative} is supposed to be smaller portions{asnegative} so you can try out more dishes{asneutral} and smaller so that each dish{asneutral} is cheap
while most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks{asnegative} in new york bars{asnegative} and hardly feeling a thing the drinks{aspositive} here are plentiful and unique
complimentary stuff{aspositive} kept coming and when the waiter{aspositive} saw me opening a gift i received my dessert{aspositive} on a plate that had happy birthday written on it with a candlevery nice touch and attentive staff{aspositive}
the food{asnegative} arrived 20 minutes after i called cold and soggy
if you go for the pre theatre menu{aspositive} it's an even greater deal
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity elegance and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood{aspositive} and vegetables{aspositive} regardless of portion size{asnegative} kai is your place
the prices{aspositive} cannot be beat for the quality{aspositive} quantity{aspositive} freshness{aspositive} and taste{aspositive}
check it out it won't hurt your stomach{aspositive} or your wallet{aspositive}
little tonino's is just awesome our favorite delivery place in kennsington honestly the best gnochi{aspositive} i have ever had
incredibly poor service{asnegative} an food quality{asnegative} at exorbitant prices{asnegative}
i have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal{aspositive}
i go back in line{asnegative} like three times on average until i can't walk anymore
we usually just get some of the dinner specials{aspositive} and they are very reasonably priced{aspositive} and very tasty
horrible food{asnegative} and horrible service{asnegative}
the wine{aspositive} and cheese{aspositive} plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue{aspositive} or table grilling{aspositive}
they treated us well and the food{aspositive} was extremely fresh and well prepared
their exotic salad{aspositive} is basic ly a delcious little green salad{aspositive} with a peanut sauce{aspositive} that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu{aspositive}
the big complaint no toasting{asnegative} available
