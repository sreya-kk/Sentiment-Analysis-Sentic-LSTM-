boot time{aspositive} is super fast around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute
tech support{asnegative} would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $150 plus
set up{aspositive} was easy
did not enjoy the new windows 8{asnegative} and touchscreen functions{asnegative}
other than not being a fan of click pads{asnegative} industry standard these days and the lousy internal speakers{asnegative} it's hard for me to find things about this notebook i don't like especially considering the $350 price tag{aspositive}
no installation disk dvd{asneutral} is included
it's fast light and simple to use{aspositive}
works{aspositive} well and i am extremely happy to be back to an apple os{aspositive}
sure it's not light and slim but the features{aspositive} make up for it 100%
i am pleased with the fast log on{aspositive} speedy wifi connection{aspositive} and the long battery life{aspositive} >6 hrs
the apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key{asnegative}
made interneting{asnegative} part of my business very difficult to maintain
luckily for all of us contemplating the decision the mac mini is priced{aspositive} just right
super light super sexy and everything just works{aspositive}
only problem that i had was that the track pad{asnegative} was not very good for me i only had a problem once or twice with it but probably my computer was a bit defective
it is super fast and has outstanding graphics{aspositive}
but the mountain lion{asnegative} is just too slow
strong build{aspositive} though which really adds to its durability{aspositive}
the battery life{aspositive} is excellent 6 7 hours without charging
i've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works{aspositive} perfectly
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8{aspositive}
the baterry{aspositive} is very longer
its size{aspositive} is ideal and the weight{aspositive} is acceptable
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance{aspositive} that the computer has supplied
this laptop has only 2 usb ports{asnegative} and they are both on the same side
it has so much more speed{aspositive} and the screen{aspositive} is very sharp
everything i wanted and everything i needed and the price{aspositive} was great
it's not inexpensive but the hardware performance{aspositive} is impressive for a computer this small
this thing is awesome everything always works{aspositive} everything is always easy to set up{aspositive} everything is compatible its literally everything i could ask for
keyboard{aspositive} responds well to presses
lastly windows 8{asnegative} is annoying
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup{aspositive} or configure{aspositive}
biggest complaint is windows 8{asnegative}
only 2 usb ports{asnegative} seems kind of limited
it has all the expected features{aspositive} and more +plus a wide screen{aspositive} and more than roomy keyboard{aspositive}
amazing performance{aspositive} for anything i throw at it
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality{aspositive} and performance{aspositive}
i was extremely happy with the os{aspositive} itself
the new mbp offers great portability{aspositive} and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months
the criticism has waned and now i'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing{aspositive}
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8{asnegative}
ms office 2011 for mac{aspositive} is wonderful well worth it
but the performance{asnegative} of mac mini is a huge disappointment
they don't just look{aspositive} good they deliver excellent performance{aspositive}
i have had it over a year now with out a glitch of any kind i love the lit up keys{aspositive} and screen display{aspositive} this thing is fast and clear as can be
the mountain lion os{aspositive} is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows{asneutral}
however i can refute that osx{asnegative} is fast
enjoy using microsoft office{aspositive}
incredible graphics{aspositive} and brilliant colors{aspositive}
built in apps{aspositive} are purely amazing
cons screen resolution{asnegative}
from the speed{aspositive} to the multi touch gestures{aspositive} this operating system{aspositive} beats windows{asnegative} easily
i really like the size{aspositive} and i'm a fan of the acers
i opted for the squaretrade 3 year computer accidental protection warranty{aspositive} $1500 2000 which also support accidents like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare{asnegative}
it's light and easy to transport{aspositive}
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set up{asnegative} you may feel frustrated
it's been time for a new laptop and the only debate was which size{asneutral} of the mac laptops and whether to spring for the retina display{asneutral}
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design{aspositive} and the aluminum casing{aspositive}
the aluminum body{aspositive} sure makes it stand out
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices{aspositive} and usb devices{aspositive} are recognized almost instantly
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip{asnegative} seems underpowered to me
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port{asneutral} will work with adapter{asneutral} and put the sdxc slot{asnegative} in a silly position on the back
the durability{aspositive} of the laptop will make it worth the money
well designed{aspositive} and fast
but i was completely wrong this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use{aspositive}
exactly as posted plus a great value{aspositive}
the specs{aspositive} are pretty good too
apple is unmatched in product quality{aspositive} aesthetics{aspositive} craftmanship{aspositive} and customer service{aspositive}
it is a great size{aspositive} and amazing windows 8{aspositive} included
i do not like too much windows 8{asnegative}
startup times{asnegative} are incredibly long over two minutes
also stunning colors{aspositive} and speedy
great price{aspositive} free shipping{aspositive} what else can i ask for
this mouse{aspositive} is terrific
it is really thick around the battery{asneutral}
and windows 7{aspositive} works like a charm
great product great price{aspositive} great delivery{aspositive} and great service{aspositive}
] it arrived so fast and customer service{aspositive} was great
tried windows 8{asnegative} and hated it
the price is higher than most lab top out there however he she will get what they paid for which is a great computer
set up{aspositive} was a breeze
but i do not like win8{asnegative}
i am still in the process of learning about its features{asneutral}
i had the same reasons as most pc users the price{asnegative} the overbearing restrictions of osx{asnegative} and lack of support for games{asnegative}
i wanted it for it's mobility{aspositive} and man this little bad boy is very nice
the investment of a new macbook pro came at a price but totally worth it for a good piece of mind
i found the mini to be exceptionally easy to set up{aspositive}
having usb3{aspositive} is why i bought this mini
the sound{aspositive} is nice and loud i don't have any problems with hearing anything
it is very slim the track pad{aspositive} is very much impressed with me
the settings{asnegative} are not user friendly either
thank goodness for openoffice{aspositive}
awesome form factor{aspositive} great battery life{aspositive} wonderful ux{aspositive}
i love the keyboard{aspositive} and the screen{aspositive}
however there are major issues with the touchpad{asnegative} which render the device nearly useless
i've already upgraded o mavericks{aspositive} and i am impressed with everything about this computer
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5{asnegative}
thanks for great service{aspositive} and shipping{aspositive}
the performance{aspositive} seems quite good and built in applications{aspositive} like iphoto{aspositive} work great with my phone and camera
i did swap out the hard drive{asneutral} for a samsung 830 ssd{aspositive} which i highly recommend
starts up{aspositive} in a hurry and everything is ready to go
yes that's a good thing but it's made from aluminum{asnegative} that scratches easily
quick and has built in virus control{aspositive}
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display{asneutral} and one without
i was also informed that the components{asnegative} of the mac book were dirty
the hardware{asnegative} problems have been so bad i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years tops
it's so nice that the battery{aspositive} last so long and that this machine has the snow lion{aspositive}
however i chose two day shipping{asnegative} and it took over a week to arrive
it's exactly what i wanted and it has all the new features{aspositive} and whatnot
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality{aspositive} of a macbook
it feels cheap the keyboard{asnegative} is not very sensitive
though please note that sometimes it crashes and the sound quality{asnegative} isnt superb
it is very easy to navigate{aspositive} even for a novice
does everything i need it to has a wonderful battery life{aspositive} and i couldn't be happier
great performance{aspositive} and quality{aspositive}
i used windows xp{asneutral} windows vista{asneutral} and windows 7{asneutral} extensively
i did add a ssd drive{asneutral} and memory{asneutral}
on start up{asnegative} it asks endless questions just so itune{asnegative} can sell you more of their products
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os{asneutral}
one more thing this mac does not come with restore disks{asnegative} and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc's also the charging cables{asnegative} are made of the same cheap material{asnegative} as the iphone ipod touch cables
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design{asneutral}
i never tried any external mics{asneutral} with that imac
the new os{aspositive} is great on my macbook pro
i had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as i remember to carry my glasses
i have experienced no problems works{aspositive} as anticipated
system{aspositive} is running great
easy to customize setting{aspositive} and even create your own bookmarks{aspositive}
the mac mini wireless keyboard mouse{asneutral} and a hdmi cable{asneutral} is all i need to get some real work done
it has all the features{aspositive} that we expected and the price{aspositive} was good working{aspositive} well so far
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with not gaming{asneutral}
the new operating system{aspositive} makes this computer into a super ipad
easy to set up{aspositive} and go
i can't believe how quiet the hard drive{aspositive} is and how quick this thing boots up{aspositive}
the only issue came when i tried scanning{asnegative} to the mac
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point{asneutral}
it's just what we were looking for and it works{aspositive} great
it's so quick and responsive that it makes working{aspositive} surfing{aspositive} on a computer so much more pleasurable
it works{aspositive} fine and all the software{aspositive} seems to run pretty well
i'm using this computer for word processing{asneutral} web browsing{asneutral} some gaming{asneutral} and i'm learning programming{asneutral}
my wife was so excited to open the box but quickly came to see that it did not function{asnegative} as it should
i wanted a computer that was quite fast and that had overall great performance{asneutral}
apple help{asnegative} is a mixed bag
it suddenly can not work{asnegative}
harddrive{asnegative} was in poor condition had to replace it
the on off switch{asnegative} is a bit obscure in the rear corner
my only complaint is the total lack of instructions{asnegative} that come with the mac mini
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming{asnegative} otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks
i'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple
i use it mostly for content creation{aspositive} audio{aspositive} video{aspositive} photo editing{aspositive} and its reliable
screen{aspositive} is bright and gorgeous
the only solution is to turn the brightness{asneutral} down etc
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications{asneutral}
it is robust with a friendly use{aspositive} as all apple products
it is fast and easy to use{aspositive}
and the fact that it comes with an i5 processor{aspositive} definitely speeds things up
i have been pc for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features{aspositive} are a great help
nice screen{aspositive} keyboard{aspositive} works great
i was amazed at how fast the delivery{aspositive} was
i've installed to it additional ssd{asneutral} and 16gb ram{asneutral}
the memory{asnegative} was gone and it was not able to be used
it works{aspositive} great and i am so happy i bought it
i like the design{aspositive} and ease of use with the keyboard{aspositive} plenty of ports{aspositive}
it definitely beats my old mac and the service{aspositive} was great
web browsing{aspositive} is very quick with safari browser{aspositive}
i like the lighted screen{aspositive} at night
it is really easy to use{aspositive} and it is quick to start up{aspositive}
i've lived with the crashes and slow operation{asnegative} and restarts
usb3 peripherals{aspositive} are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt{asnegative} ones
and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty{aspositive} no problems
it's fast light and is perfect for media editing{aspositive} which is mostly why i bought it in the first place
the battery{aspositive} lasts as advertised give or take 15 20 minutes and the entire user experience{aspositive} is very elegant
thanks for the fast shipment{aspositive} and great price{aspositive}
excelent performance{aspositive} usability{aspositive} presentation{aspositive} and time response{aspositive}
the smaller size{aspositive} was a bonus because of space restrictions
i blame the mac os{asnegative}
in fact i still use manylegacy programs{asneutral} appleworks{asneutral} filemaker pro{asneutral} quicken{asneutral} photoshop{asneutral} etc
i like the operating system{aspositive}
i love the form factor{aspositive}
it's fast at loading the internet{aspositive}
so much faster and sleeker looking{aspositive}
unfortunately it runs xp{asneutral} and microsoft is dropping support{asnegative} next april
first off i really do like my mbp once used to the os{aspositive} it is pretty easy to get around and the overall build{aspositive} is great eg the keyboard{aspositive} is one of the best to type on
it is made of such solid construction{aspositive} and since i have never had a mac using my iphone helped me get used to the system{asneutral} a bit
very nice unibody construction{aspositive}
this macbook pro is fast powerful and runs{aspositive} super quiet and cool
it's ok but doesn't have a disk drive{asneutral} which i didn't know until after i bought it
there is no hdmi receptacle{asneutral} nor is there an sd card slot{asneutral} located anywhere on the device
it came in brand new and works{aspositive} perfectly
it shouldn't happen like that i don't have any design app{asneutral} open or anything
my trackpad{asnegative} is not working
it looks{aspositive} and feels{aspositive} solid with a flawless finish{aspositive}
price{asnegative} was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price{aspositive} showing on pc when i bought this product
then the system{asnegative} would many times not power down{asnegative} without a forced power off
the configuration{aspositive} is perfect for my needs
and the speakers{asnegative} is the worst ever
its the best its got the looks{aspositive} super easy to use{aspositive} and love all you can do with the trackpad{aspositive}
web surfuring{aspositive} is smooth and seamless
i'm overall pleased with the interface{aspositive} and the portability{aspositive} of this product
this item is a beautiful piece it works{aspositive} well it is easy to carry{aspositive} and handle{aspositive}
it was also suffering from hardware keyboard{asnegative} issues relatively slow performance{asnegative} and shortening battery lifetime{asnegative}
runs{aspositive} good and does the job can't complain about that
it's silent and has a very small footprint{aspositive} on my desk
the exterior{aspositive} is absolutely gorgeous
it has a very high performance{aspositive} just for what i needed for
apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design{asneutral} involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset{asneutral}
osx mountain lion{asneutral} soon to upgrade to mavericks{asneutral}
i just bought the new macbook pro the 13 model and i can't believe apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to usb ports{asnegative}
it wakes{aspositive} in less than a second when i open the lid{asneutral}
it is the perfect size{aspositive} and speed{aspositive} for me
the customer service{aspositive} is terrific
my last laptop was a 17 asus gaming machine which performed{aspositive} admirably but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago
however it did not have any scratches zero battery cycle count{aspositive} pretty surprised and all the hardware{aspositive} seemed to be working perfectly
after fumbling around with the os{asnegative} i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue
and as for all the fancy finger swipes{asnegative} i just gave up and attached a mouse{asneutral}
i needed a laptop with big storage{asneutral} a nice screen{asneutral} and fast so i can photoshop{asneutral} without any problem
i like coming back to mac os{aspositive} but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality{asnegative} compared to my $400 old hp laptop
shipped{aspositive} very quickly and safely
the thunderbolt port{aspositive} is awesome
the performance{aspositive} is definitely superior to any computer i've ever put my hands on
it's great for streaming video{aspositive} and other entertainment uses{aspositive}
i like the design{aspositive} and its features{aspositive} but there are somethings i think needs to be improved
there were small problems with mac office{asnegative}
i understand i should call apple tech support{asneutral} about any variables which is my purpose of writing this con as variables could be a bigger future problem
i ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec{asnegative} of the new 27 imacs
it still works{aspositive} and it's extremely user friendly so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
its fast easy to use{aspositive} and it looks{aspositive} great
but office{asneutral} can be purchased if i ever need a laptop again i am for sure purchasing another toshiba
i haven't tried the one with retina display{asneutral} maybe in the future
performance{aspositive} is much much better on the pro especially if you install an ssd{aspositive} on it
note however that any existing magsafe accessories{asneutral} you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection{asnegative}
the only thing i dislike is the touchpad{asnegative} alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too i would recommend using a mouse{asneutral} with it
the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs{aspositive} very quiet actually the fans{aspositive} aren't audible unlike my old pc
maybe the mac os{asnegative} improvement were not the product they want to offer
i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem{asneutral}
it's absolutely wonderful and worth the price{aspositive}
i am please with the products ease of use{aspositive} out of the box ready appearance{aspositive} and functionality{aspositive}
perfect for all my graphic design{aspositive} classes i'm taking this year in college
i will not be using that slot{asnegative} again
the os{aspositive} is fast and fluid everything is organized and it's just beautiful
they are simpler to use{aspositive}
so nice stable fast now i got my ssd{aspositive}
also in using the built in camera{asneutral} my voice recording{asnegative} for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the star wars saga
i love the quick start up{aspositive}
you just cannot beat the functionality{aspositive} of an apple device
yet my mac continues to function{aspositive} properly
graphics{aspositive} are much improved
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase build quality{aspositive} seriously you can't beat a unibody construction{aspositive}
it provides much more flexibility for connectivity{aspositive}
i want the portability{aspositive} of a tablet without the limitations of a tablet and that's where this laptop comes into play
mac tutorials{aspositive} do help
the technical support{asnegative} was not helpful as well
i got the new adapter{asneutral} and there was no change
so i called technical support{asneutral}
came with iphoto{asneutral} and garage band{asneutral} already loaded
logic board{aspositive} utterly fried cried and laid down and died
the sound{asnegative} was crappy even when you turn up the volume{asnegative} still the same results
osx lion{aspositive} is a great performer extremely fast and reliable
having heard from friends and family about how reliable a mac product is i never expected to have an application{asnegative} crash within the first month but i did
the macbook pro's physical form{aspositive} is wonderful
the mini's body{aspositive} hasn't changed since late 2010 and for a good reason
the unibody construction{aspositive} really does feel lot more solid than apple's previous laptops
3d rendering{asnegative} slows it down considerably
got this mac mini with os x mountain lion{asneutral} for my wife
fast great screen{aspositive} beautiful apps{aspositive} for a laptop priced{asneutral} at 1100 on the apple website amazon had it for 1098+ tax plus i had a 10% off coupon from amazon cost{asneutral} me 998 plus tax 1070 otd
12 44 seconds to boot{asneutral}
all the ports{asneutral} are much needed since this is my main computer
the like new condition of the imac mc309ll a on amazon is at $900+ level only and it is a quad core 2 5 ghz cpu{asneutral} similar to the $799 mini with radeon hd 6750m 512mb graphic card{asneutral} this mini is integrated intel 4000 card{asneutral} and it even comes with wireless apple keyboard and mouse{asneutral} all put together in neat and nice package{aspositive}
put a cover{asneutral} on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint
within a few hours i was using the gestures{aspositive} unconsciously
this mac does come with an extender cable{asneutral} and i'm using mine right now hoping the cable{aspositive} will stay nice for the many years i plan on using this mac
the 2 9ghz dual core i7 chip{aspositive} really out does itself
it is pretty snappy and starts up{aspositive} in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me
so noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better now it doesn't feel hot but warm
not sure on windows 8{asneutral}
my one complaint is that there was no internal cd drive{asnegative}
this newer netbook has no hard drive{asneutral} or network lights{asneutral}
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 macbook air or the macbook pro 13 both baseline models priced{asneutral} at 1 200 $ retail
not too expense and has enough storage{aspositive} for most users and many ports{aspositive}
the audio volume{asnegative} is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity
it is lightweight and the perfect size{aspositive} to carry to class
i was given a demonstration of windows 8{asneutral}
the mbp is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities{aspositive}
i thought that it will be fine if i do some settings{asneutral}
runs{aspositive} very smoothly
boot up{asnegative} slowed significantly after all windows updates{asnegative} were installed
more likely it will require replacing the logic board{asnegative} once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution
it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet{aspositive} word processing{aspositive} graphic design{aspositive} and gaming{aspositive}
i like the mini mac it was easy to setup{aspositive} and install{aspositive} but i am learning as i go and could use a tutorial{asneutral} to learn how to use some of the features{asneutral} i was use to on the pc especially the right mouse click menu{asneutral}
runs{aspositive} real quick
buy the separate ram memory{aspositive} and you will have a rocket
since the machine's slim profile{asnegative} is critical to me that was a problem
wifi capability{aspositive} disk drive{aspositive} and multiple usb ports{aspositive} to connect scale and printers was all that was required
the sd card reader{asnegative} is slightly recessed and upside down the nail slot on the card{asnegative} cannot be accessed if this was a self ejecting slot{asnegative} this would not be an issue but its not
soft touch{aspositive} anodized aluminum{aspositive} with laser cut precision and no flaws
simple details crafted aluminium{aspositive} and real glass{aspositive} make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden bulky sticker filled laptops
first of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum{aspositive}
after all was said and done i essentially used that $450 savings to buy 16gb of ram{asneutral} two seagate momentus xt hybrid drives{asneutral} and an owc upgrade kit{asneutral} to install the second hard drive{asneutral}
the dell inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard{aspositive} which i miss on my apple laptops
i was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive{aspositive} would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried this machine is the fastest i have ever owned
this one still has the cd slot{asneutral}
no hdmi port{asneutral}
i had to install mountain lion{asnegative} and it took a good two hours
customization{asnegative} on mac is impossible
i am replacing the hd{asneutral} with a micron ssd{asneutral} soon
plus two finger clicking{aspositive} as a replacement for the right click button{asneutral} is surprisingly intuitive
the superdrive{aspositive} is quiet
the power plug{asnegative} has to be connected to the power adaptor{asneutral} to charge the battery{asneutral} but won't stay connected
the battery{asnegative} was completely dead in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside
if yo like practicality{aspositive} this is the laptop for you
the os{aspositive} is great
i tried several monitors{asneutral} and several hdmi cables{asneutral} and this was the case each time
cons price{asnegative} is a bit ridiculous kinda heavy
the troubleshooting said it was the ac adaptor{asneutral} so we ordered a new one
fan{asneutral} only comes on when you are playing a game{asneutral}
which it did not have only 3 usb 2 ports{asneutral}
no startup disk{asneutral} was not included but that may be my fault
there is no tools menu{asneutral}
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program{asnegative}
needs a cd dvd drive{asneutral} and a bigger power switch{asnegative}
my laptop with windows 7{asnegative} crashed and i did not want windows 8{asnegative}
easy to install{aspositive} also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi{aspositive}
the speakers could have been better but it wasn't a deal breaker this is a great little laptop love it
nice packing{aspositive}
i switched to this because i wanted something different even though i miss windows{aspositive}
apple no longer includes idvd{asnegative} with the computer and furthermore apple doesn't even offer it anymore
i also wanted windows 7{aspositive} which this one has
at first i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the mac system{asnegative}
i am used to computers with windows{asneutral} so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around
it just works{aspositive} out of the box and you have a lot of cool software{aspositive} included with the os{asneutral}
its as advertised on here it works{aspositive} great and is not a waste of money
runs{aspositive} like a champ
premium price{aspositive} for the os{asneutral} more than anything else
i was a little concerned about the touch pad{aspositive} based on reviews but i've found it fine to work with
i bought this mac book pro along with a new 27 imac and while they are still light years more reliable than a pc i have noticed a decline in the reliability of my mac computers
the sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best but it can be solved with headphones{asneutral}
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times sometimes too sensitive and sometimes a bit unresponsive but it's usable
however the experience was great since the os{aspositive} does not become unstable and the application{aspositive} will simply shutdown and reopen
if you ask me for this price{asnegative} it should be included
the battery{asnegative} is not as shown in the product photos
even though i could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price i still think there's nothing like a mac
shipping{aspositive} was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more
the retina display display{aspositive} make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping
the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing{aspositive} out there
instead i'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware{asneutral} itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy
other ports{asneutral} include firewire 800{asneutral} gigabit ethernet{asneutral} magsafe port{asneutral} microphone jack{asneutral}
additionally there is barely a ventilation system{asnegative} in the computer and even the simple activity of watching videos{asneutral} let alone playing steam games{asneutral} causes the laptop to get very very hot and in fact impossible to keep on lap
chatting with acer support{asneutral} i was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files{asneutral}
it's been a couple weeks since the purchase and i'm struggle with finding the correct keys{asneutral} but that was expected
many people complain about the new os{asnegative} and it's urgent for apple to fix it asap
now that i have upgraded to lion{aspositive} i am much happier about mac os{aspositive} and have just bought an imac for office
user upgradeable ram{aspositive} and hdd{aspositive}
but i wanted the pro for the cd dvd player{aspositive}
the ram memory is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb
i was a little worry at first because i don't have a lot of experience with os x{asneutral} and windows{aspositive} has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows{asneutral}
with the softwares{asneutral} supporting the use of other os{asneutral} makes it much better
i then upgraded to mac os x 10 8 mountain lion{asneutral}
i was considering buying the air but in reality this one has a more powerful performance{aspositive} and seems much more convenient even though it's about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 lcd screen{asneutral} so built in screen size{asneutral} is not terribly important
just beware no dvd slot{asneutral} so when i went to install software{asnegative} i had on cd i couldn't
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program{asneutral} to do so
this version of macbook pro runs on a third generation cpu ivy bridge{asneutral} not the latest fourth generation haswell cpu{asneutral} the 2013 version has

every time i log into the system{asnegative} after a few hours there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through
put a ssd{asneutral} and use a 21 led screen{asneutral} this set up{aspositive} is silky smooth
the case{asnegative} is now slightly larger than the previous generation but the lack of an external power supply{asneutral} justifies the small increase in size

i was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon com than it was in the mac store
the nicest part is the low heat output{aspositive} and ultra quiet operation{aspositive}
i will upgrade the ram{aspositive} myself because with this model you can you can do it later on
the price{aspositive} is 200 dollars down
this mac mini does not have a built in mic{asneutral} and it would seem that its mac os 10 9{asnegative} does not handle external microphones{asneutral} properly
a lot of features{asneutral} and shortcuts{asneutral} on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc
wasn't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the ios system{aspositive} on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different

it has enough memory{aspositive} and speed{aspositive} to run my business with all the flexibility{aspositive} that comes with a laptop

fine if you have a touch screen{asneutral}
as far as user type i dabble in everything from games{asneutral} wow to photoshop{asneutral} but nothing professionally

the os{aspositive} is easy and offers all kinds of surprises
i had to get apple customer support{asneutral} to correct the problem
a veryimportant feature is firewire 800{aspositive} which in my experience works better then usb3{asnegative} in pc enabled with usb3{asneutral} i was not originally sold on the mac os{asnegative} i felt it was inferior in many ways to windows 7{aspositive}
